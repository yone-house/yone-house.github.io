All right, hello everyone, thank you so much for joining. Can everyone hear me okay?

Awesome. And we also have some people zooming in here, so I'm… I'm standing on both sides. Um, thank you all so much for joining us. My name is Taylor Towns. I'm one of the co-directors of Blue Stoop.

Um, if you are not aware of what we are, we are a home for Philly writers. We do creative writing workshops, like the one we're having today.

We also do, um, events, opportunities for writers and readers throughout the city and beyond.

Um, and we're really excited to be here with Alexander Chee, learning about the stories you've never seen before.

Um, we are having people Zoom in, so there may be moments if we ask to stop for questions, I might be over here reading from the chat.

Um, and then Alexander will also open up for questions towards the end. If you have any needs.

Please feel free, bathroom is right to your right. And there is also, um, waters and some popcorn.

We're all set to go, and let me just check in and make sure audio is all good here, Julian.

Awesome. We're getting started! Okay? Um.

It's great to be back in Philadelphia. I… And in most cases, uh, I have enough… I'm kind of… epic event for my essay collection year.

Back in 2018 that I… from somewhere in Canada, so it's a pleasure now.

Giving money back to votes for Blue Soup and A Sharks in the shoe.

We co-sponsored that at that time. Um, I was thinking about how to… go into this, uh, talk and… And then I… I was trying to write a newsletter over the weekend, uh.

How disappointed I was, buddy. Little marks.

Um, good apologies to all of the middle orange bands fans that are no doubt.

Yeah, yeah. Um… But I'm going somewhere with this, so please bear with me.

Identified, uh… you know, I've been… I draw tarot cards for myself periodically to clarify things. I kept.

Getting, uh, the hanged man. Card, which is not a great card. Um… Uh, usually means that you're a skin cut of some kind, or you're being… uh, like, some sort of program because of the opinion that you have that's…

Popular, like, maybe to sing Millmarch. And so I… I shifted courses, and then I stopped drawing the Hangman card, so that was a very interesting…

Playing with my name. Um… But, um, I realize that part of what was…

Part of what was… Part of what's disappointing to me, in particular, relating.

So the novel was that I had read this book about.

Mm-hmm. About George Eliot's… life, which was much more interesting.

To me, and I realize that the novel I wanted. Was the one that she most likely thought she couldn't write back then.

A kind of imagined novel. Projected across… The one that she actually wrote, which is, of course, unfair to her.

Uh, literary history, etc. It's a completely, um. A completely indulgent and selfish wish.

That you could turn into a novel. Which is kind of where I'm going with it.

I think part of what… Um, part of what we're after here.

In thinking this way, um… is to think about, uh… To think about some of these, uh.

These moments. Where we have choices that we could make as writers.

And… and we can think about, like. What has already been accomplished, and then what could still be accomplished.

Something that… may cross your mind periodically.

As you're thinking about your own writing? Uh, part of what we're after is… Also… How do we get to the stories that we know.

Aren't there, but that we never… Somehow.

Get to see, so… But we're still waiting for. I'm remembering…

And I'm remembering a particular phenomenon. Trying to figure out how much of this conversation I can actually describe without getting in trouble.

Um, but I'm gonna give it a shot. I was judging a literary.

And we had settled on… Most of the group had settled on.

This one book for the winner.

And… it was… The novel… that I thought was something that I had never… I've never seen anyone pull off.

Um. And somebody… on the committee who was trying to kind of, like.

I guess we could say… ding it down, because they… thought something else deserved a top spot.

Basically trying to act as if this novel was so normal.

From… Uh, from a cultural perspective.

And it wasn't at all. It seemed… Shockingly unfair to me.

Uh, that, um… that would happen. I'm really trying hard not to describe the novel.

Uh, and… That's… I can… I mean… I Google it.

Uh… the… the sort of, uh… Where am I going with this?

The conversation won the day. Those of us who were in the majority prevailed.

Uh, this person with their strange, thigh-long. Attempt to act as if literary history were all of these things.

Which it was not full of. Uh, you know, was… was what prevailed in the end. Um… But it did make me think about how, um.

How precarious, even when we are able to pull these things off.

How precarious their position is, or can be. Uh, in the world. Um… And yet, you know, what was maybe… even more satisfying in some ways was that.

We made our decision about the prize. It was still some months before the prize was announced.

Uh, and the novel took off in this incredible way. And was embraced by readers who… who were not fooled in the way that this person on the committee tried before.

Um… Which I suppose is my way of saying that, like, when you are able to.

Win through to the other side with this kind of story.

That there is something… that, uh… I mean, that protects you, and I think it is that relationship to the reader.

Um. Now, why am I thinking about all this? I'm thinking about all this in part because.

My own first novel. Is thought of as one of these folks.

Nothing, I can say that, uh, without seeming like… And I know how… unusual it was, and or still is.

Uh, precisely because… At the time that it was on submission.

Publishers seemed entirely confused about what kind of book to write.

I've written a bit about this. In my first ethnic election, how to write an autobiographical novel.

Um, uh, which is a completely sarcastic title. It's not at all sincere, how to guide.

Uh, and, uh, and then by psychopathic, I mean… The title came from answering the question of, like, how autobiographical is it for, like.

Decade, including in relationship to my second novel, which was set.

And second, Empire France. Been told the story of an opera singer.

Who believed her voice was cursed, and she was trying to use the curse to get what she wanted.

Out of life. Now…

How autobiographical was that? At that point, I just started saying.

It's all true. I lived through the whole thing. Uh, I am, and you've caught me out. I'm a 19th century officer.

Um. But I think part of what, uh… part of what begs the question.

Is when you are able to excavate into. The emotional life of a character.

I say excavate because, to me, it always feels like they already exist.

Even though I know I'm making them up. That I'm pushing my way through.

Uh… something… where my minds.

The years between me and whatever era I'm writing about. Um… Trying to locate something… And I want… that I feel sure is there, even though I have no reason to believe it.

The kind of dowsing exercise, in a way. Without making it sound too… Looks like a… Um, like, go… a woo-wooz kind of story, which I think is always a funny thing to say, because actually.

The way you're supposed to say, who… I realize is.

Um, like the sort of crazy ghost. Um.

Going off the rails.

The way that, uh… The way that I found my stories in both cases, though, was I was using.

I was using the emotional architecture. Of things I had experienced without using… the actual event.

And so… Over time, I'm going to talk tonight about a series of stories that are not mine.

Um, where I feel like… Uh, what we can see… is the way that, uh, this… writer found this emotional architecture.

Uh, this kind of, uh… the energy of a story that they were already telling, the energy of a story that was being told about them.

The energy of a story that… They were telling themselves.

When they were afraid. Uh, the energy of a story they were telling themselves.

Uh, maybe as they experimented. With the thoughts.

And ideas that they were playing around with. A couple of different approaches.

Um, uh, I'm hoping to get through… fair amount of material. We will take a short break, but um… We're going to be covering… James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain… Dennis Johnson's Jesus Son… Isabella Hamad's, uh, short story, Mr. Kanan, over at.

Here's from you. Um, a story by… of T. Cola, called… a party for the colonel.

And if I… If I get there, and I hope to… Uh, in the life by Becky Berkman.

Alright, so… Uh, before I start talking about any of this, I'd like you… Uh, to take a moment.

A couple of minutes, we'll say… let's say 5 minutes total.

==I want you to think about… Either a story that your family tells about you.==

==To you. Or in front of you, especially when you bring.==

==Someone new into… Circle.==

==It's usually a story of you when. Uh, your age is, like, probably 0 to 6?==

==Um, it's usually… story that's designed to show the listeners.==

==That, uh… That your family really knows you.==

==In this way that, uh… that they don't… the newcomer.==[^6]

Um, if you don't have one of these stories, it may be… Instead, you have a story that you always tell.

About your family, in which case, write that down. Um, but just to summarize it.

Uh, in 5 minutes, it's 6.17 right now. Uh, we will talk about it again at 22.

Okay, take any notes you need to keep your place. Is your thoughts?

==So, uh… Part of the way that this exercise works.==

==Uh, from their perspective of you being the subject of a story that your family tells about you.==

==Especially from an age when you can't… remember it, right? The way they do.==

==Is that usually what you do in order to have a relationship to the story?==

==Is that you take… pictures of yourself from the time.==

==That you… are being described at.==

==And you create in your mind something that is like a memory, but that is not a memory.==

==And the reason why it is different is because it is in the third person.==

==You're watching yourself, your character, in a movie. That you have animated.==

==When you do that, uh… So that whenever this story is told.==

==You plan this out in your head. Uh, and… Uh, you probably have a reaction to it. You may be embarrassed.==

==That is often the point of the story. Um, and… that energy builds up over time.==

==And that act that you… that you did to create the kind of fake memory, as it were.==

==Uh, that is something that I think of as a proto-fiction.==

==Kind of first fiction. Uh, where you are… Uh, you are… doing something almost automatically.==

==Um… to have a relationship to a feeling that you are uncomfortable with.==

==And that is also how you can approach writing fiction. Like, whatever else you do with this exercise.==

==You can think of it that way, where you are assembling.==

==A kind of collage of… images from wherever, really. It just happens to be that… Because you are the subject, you use yourself, but you can use.==

==Whoever. Um, but for our purposes tonight, and for this particular exercise.==

==Um… Take it farther, I'll use an example.==[^2]

Um. A story my mother actually has a lot of these stories.

Uh, but a story that she likes to tell a lot.

About how… Uh, when I was… a toddler, I would… hide behind the furniture in a particular room.

Waiting for people to enter, and when they started talking. I would imitate them, like a little echo.

Hidden behind the wall. Um, and one day.

What happened was my grandmother. My eldest aunt were having a terrible fight and walking… One of those fights where you're walking around the house while you're having the fight?

Arguing room to room, and uh… one person, obviously, is trying to get away, the other one.

Pursuing. Uh, they walked into the living room, and I started imitating them. My grandmother thought it was hilarious.

I started laughing, uh, and my aunt… I might still be mad about it.

Now, I… I have no… way to remember this. Except… Through my mother's telling.

Um… So, here we come to the next part of the exercise.

Which is, what is the story about? No… In my case.

==Looking at this, I realized that. The story was about… someone who was good.==

==Imitating others. And because of it.==

==They had gotten into… a trouble that they did not understand.==

==It was, like, a reflective… have it done to amuse others. I knew that people found it funny.==

==Uh, usually. Um, but in this case.==

==I had trust that in a way that I couldn't understand.==

==Because I was not the people that I was imitating.==

==So… In a way, quote-unquote, that is not about me.==[^4]

Even though it is about me, because I am… a gifted mimic, you know, like… There's a reason shape-changing is a regular theme inside of my fiction.

Um. But, uh.

==What I ask you now to you. For, say, 5 more minutes before we go on.==

==To everything else that we're going to talk about. Uh, try to think of what is your story about?==

==And if it's… if it is a story that you were telling about others.==

==Uh, should that be the direction that you chose? Trying to think the same way. I try to take your role, in a sense.==

==As a storyteller, how did it stand back from the story and ask yourself.==

==What if that story really about? Would I strip it down.==

==So it's bare bones… what am I describing in there?==

==For other people.==[^5]

628, we'll pick up again at 6… 33.

Okay. So… Here is how I put this exercise into use for myself.

I use this attribute. Way of being a mimic.

Like, that's in trouble, because you do not know what you are imitating exactly.

==Um, gets into trouble you don't anticipate as a result. Use that… as a kind of character engine for my main character in the Queen of the Night.==

==When I say a character engine, what I mean is, uh, what is the kind of… pattern of their life.==

==When they get into trouble, what do they instinctively do? Uh, what is the thing that they reach for that.==

==That, uh, propels them. They think, uh, towards rescue, but in fact, also.==

==Probably sends them further into… the trouble that they are… or have gotten themselves into.==

==And, uh… And it's a different kind of… different kind of way of relating to.==

==A character's life. But I think it's one that is closer to how we all.==

==Engage with our lives in some way, which is that… We have talents that we are good at.==

==And those talents are what we tend to lean on. Even when we should not.==

==Because we know that there are talents, and part of what we're learning in this life.==

==Is how to know when to use that talent. And when not to.==

==Um. Uh, it's the… it's the kind of trouble that you were always going to get into.==

==Uh, which can look like fate, also. But it is something that… the intimate to you as a person.==

==An intimate, then also… to your characters, because only they… can draw this particular magic.==

==Uh, into their life.==[^7]

==Okay, so… This brings me to, uh, James Baldwin, speaking of talent.==

And… go on the mountain. Um, if you have not read this novel.

I highly… recommended. I highly encourage you.

To read it, I also recommend that you take the time.

When you're alone, to try reading parts of it aloud. Because it is an incredibly beautiful and distilled piece of fiction.

I had something wrong with mine. Okay.

On Zoom, they're having trouble? Okay. Sorry, guys.

All right. Um, novels protagonist is John Grimes.

He is the son of the Haddeacon at the Temple of the Fire Baptized in Harlem and New York City.

He is 14 years old when the novel begins, and it is his birthday.

Uh, he has a tremendous ambivalence about that, which is conveyed almost immediately.

Uh, partly because… is unsure whether anyone is going to wish them happy birthday that day.

Which does, strangely enough. Resemble the plot of 16 Candles, but… Anyway, um… Baldwin makes it in a very different direction.

Uh, the… The question, however, is an animating question.

That will take us very far in… The life of John Grimes and the life of the people around him.

And the question of why no one would wish him. Happy birthday, or why he imagines no one would do that.

Um. Uh, he… is ambivalent about the church at the center of his life.

His father's church. He cannot quite admit. To a crush on… Uh, the pastor's nephew.

Alyssa? And instead, he imagines that it is a need to be as holy as him.

Uh, we are made aware from the beginning of the novel that it weighs on him that he's never been struck by the power.

In the way that signifies belonging in this church. He has never flung himself.

We had steed in ecstasy, singing and praising God, and he feels outside the circle of community.

And when she has spent his life, the peasant did. But also partly because he knows he's queer.

And so… What happens in the process of the story is that, and I don't want to spoil it.

But I will break it down a fair amount, and I hope you will… Still read it, and forgive me for the breakdown.

It is a story about… John, wondering if he has… Uh, send himself for thinking of the other boys at school in the way that he does.

Uh, he has… Also, already secretly decided to defy the expectations.

Of those who believe he should become like his father, to become another deacon, and it's instead.

Committed himself to secular accomplishments at school. Where his teacher's husband, he had a great teacher.

And then he might, of course, become a great leader of his people.

This is a short quote from the novel. Donald's not much interested in the people, and still less interested in leading them anywhere, but the phrase, though often repeated.

In his mind, like, a great brass gate. Opening outward for him.

On a world… Where people did not live in the darkness of his father's house.

Do not pray to Jesus in the darkness of His Father's church.

For he would eat good food and wear fine clothes and go to the movies as often as he wished.

In this world, John, who was, as his father said, ugly, who was always the smallest boy in his class.

And he had no friend, became immediately dutiful, tall, popular. People fell all over themselves to meet John Grimes.

He was a poet, or a college president. Or a movie star who'd track expensive whiskey, and he smoked like he strikes cigarettes.

In the green pack. Someone, in other words.

Like James Baldwin. Now, before we reflect too much on the connection between John and James, which does matter.

I would say, uh… But part of what.

Is going on in this novel. Uh, is… that he is moving towards… kind of meeting with the state.

And what we can see is that there are approximately 3 vectors pushing him.

In that direction. One is. Who John is… And who he fears, he will always be.

Uh, two is who John hoped to be. And fears, he never will be.

And three years… who John fears he is.

Secretly. Now, these are 3 different… interrelated forces.

That push on him inside of the novel, so… who John is, and who he fears, he will always be.

Who John hopes to be. And fears he never will be.

And then who John Fiercy is. Secretly.

And so here we get, uh, ourselves to the sense of John as talented.

His talent is his intelligence, and it is something. But in the novel, he uses to modulate all of these identities, all of these fears.

He hopes his talent will rescue him from who he is.

That it will transform him into who he hopes to be, and fears he never will be.

But it will rescue him from who he fears he is.

And always will be. Of the dreams elucidated in the novel, it is telling that he does not dream of being an openly gay man.

Uh, John knows everyone expects him to be a preacher. That is who he fears. He is, and always will be, the son of his father.

He wants to become a capital F. Someone. A celebrated intellectual figure of some kind, known for his great intelligence.

And married with a wife and family. It's the world he desires and fears he will never enter.

This is how he hopes to deal with who he fears he is.

And who he fears he'll always be, as well as who hears.

Is secretly.

So the novel is, in a sense, about someone taking up the question.

How do I solve… the unsolvable problem.

That is me. And what do I mean by that? What I mean is that he knows.

He will disappoint. Country is dead.

And he had not yet found… a vision of… Happy to… that involved that transfer themselves.

So… Uh, there's a plot and a subplot.

The plotted that a young man feels he can never overcome his hatred for his father in a way that will give him a relationship to God.

And so he decides that salvation is elsewhere. Not in the church, not in the life he's expected to lead.

Uh, he gets not what he wished for then, but what he believed was impossible.

Um, there's a scene where he and Alicia are struck by the power together.

They achieve a sublime Connected Net. And it is as if the desire for sex has been made safer.

Because they are… Uh, inactivity on the floor together, not… joined, but joined, and it's been.

Um, simultaneous divine expertise.

The other story here is that it bothers not his father.

And you will never know in the course of the novel.

But the way that influences his life will become known. Because of the way the novel is structured.

So there are… Three other characters who tell… Or whose stories, rather, become part of the novel.

Um, and so what… emerges from all this is… a stereoscopic null.

Periscopic Dory. The same story from… there were more points of view as what stereoscopic.

Through it. Uh… And… Each of these people has.

A piece of the story about John that John does not have.

And will not get over the course of the novel. And so, as the reader, you are being admitted, essentially, to a secret.

Sense of John. That John does not have.

And… It is, and it's been a story about John that John could only tell.

If he were to become… Someone like James Baldwin.

And learn all of what… He does not know at the age that he is.

He ain's the story to God.

So, part of what we see, then. Emerging is a sense of… the way that… John and his father are each the antagonist.

To the other in the story of their lives. If it was a novel about his father.

Antagonists and events would be… His son, who is not his son.

Someone else's fine. Uh, and… And that is a really interesting way to think through how you might.

Configure a story.

Whether or not you pick up a structure like this. Um, you can imagine trying to do it.

Think of a character who relies in some way on a talent.

Think of how they make use of it. To interact with their hopes.

Dreams and fears. Uh, including the fears that they don't even acknowledge to themselves.

==Because that's part of your role as a writer, is to have a sense of.==

==A sense of the unconscious. Qualities of your character.==

==And what drives them in ways that they don't know.==

==Imagining this kind of stereoscope around the character also allows you to think through.==

==Questions for the story, such as… You know, is this story that you have come across really a story in which you are… based on you.==

==Is that character really a central character? Or is someone else's eventual character?==

==Should the story be narrated. From that point of view.==

==Or should someone else's point of view prevail?==[^8]

Uh, are you… Or the character based on you, is that character… better as a witness.

Or better in the character.

Uh, there is a tremendous intimacy that Baldwin has with. The world of John Grimes, which comes from the way that it is set in his.

In his world. In the world that is to say. That James Baldwin grew up in.

And so it has an authority as a result that you cannot.

Otherwise fake. Uh, and… That is part of what… I would encourage you to think about, in relationship to yourself.

One is… What are your worlds?

And do you want to tell a story. From those worlds.

And if so, what stories would you tell?

Okay, so… Are there any questions about.

What I've described so far.

Anything you want me to clarify?

Yes, uh… So the question for those of you who.

Art in the room was, uh, talking about. John and his father being antagonists to each other, she, uh… Is it because… That is not his father's son.

And yes, that is exactly why. Uh, there's a way in which.

Gabriel will never… forgive his existence.

And he will also never describe that. Because of his pride to John.

And so, John, as a result. Does not know why his father beats him this way.

And so part of what you see there is a… kind of emotional edifice.

Built out of… the pride of the Father, who will not admit this, and the pride of a son, who will never ask him.

We have some questions in the chat? Yeah. Do you consider the queen of the night to be your world's? If yes, how?

Hmm. Uh… I think of it, no, I don't think of it as… quote-unquote, my world. I think of it as… Uh, I was very much trying to get away from myself when I wrote that novel.

And, um… And to get away from… the world I was living in.

Uh, I think one thing that can happen when you write about yourself autobiographically is that.

You get so sick of yourself. Uh, that you just wanna… put on a disguise and run away, and that is basically what I did.

Um, so I guess you could say that the world that I found, to the extent that it is.

My world, I would say it's because I followed. My hunches, uh… through to the story that I found.

I was interested in telling a story.

People were always talking about the political power that courtesans had in the 19th century, but they would never tell you.

What any of them had actually done. When any of them had actually pulled off.

And I found a story that was often told about the Comtesse de Castilione.

I was, uh… famous courtesan lover of, uh, Napoleon 3.

Was that she had stopped Bismarck from shelling the Louvre during the siege of Paris.

Uh, and the idea behind the story was that. She had impressed upon him.

The significance of the art in the Louvre.

And that he should not… I'll destroy it with German bombs.

Pressing button. Now, this seemed incredibly… sentimental, and of course, part of it relies on.

The legendary power of the Comtessa's beauty. She was a famous beauty in her… in her day.

Um, but I knew… that one, she had probably pulled it off, and two.

But she had pulled it off differently. But there was something that she had.

Come across that he wanted. Some kind of… political lever, some sort of… Something like that. And so, I… made it up.

Um, because it was lost to history. This other story intervened.

And that would… that was how it became my world, if you will.

Bye, Matthew. Awesome. Um… We'd like to hear more about the self-character as witness.

So, uh… There are the stories that you… hell, because you have come into possession of them. You are the narrator because.

You've come in possession of all the pieces of the story. The classic.

Version of that is the Great Gatsby. Where, uh… the narrator, Nick, uh… is not a main character, but he is the witness. He is the person.

Who somehow talks to everyone who has a story about Gatsby.

Let me put together a story about Gatsby. I think Gatsby doesn't know, uh, and could never put together himself.

Um, especially because of… the way it is.

Here is the story that, uh… For you are not only the witness, but you are also the main character.

Because you are… the person who… experienced it, and uh… That is, uh… Well, in the case of my own work, I think of Edinburgh as being a story like that.

Although there is a second there… who is significant.

Um… challengers, uh, Catcher in the Rye.

Is a main character who is also the witness. Do his own story.

Is that it? Um, you answered this a little bit, but, um, would you say that stereoscopic novels have multiple worlds?

==Uh… I… Only if the subject of the novel passes through them.==[^10]

==But part of what… you are doing, and you set up a stereoscope.==

==Is that you're trying to deliver a kind of more… a kind of multidimensional sense of the story that no single person.==

==Uh, in the story hat. But the reader comes into the vessel.==

==By reading all the different sections of the book.== So, it may be that… You have, like in the case of Ann Beattie's The Doctor's house.

Which is a stereoscopic novel. Uh, there are all these different characters who have a different sense of… this one character who does not speak in the story.

But everyone talk about it. And, uh, and through that, you come to understand them in a way that none of them.

No. They know collectively, but they don't know it, because they don't tell each other.

All right, last question, um… Earlier, you mentioned how, uh, how to use the emotional architecture of things you experience without using the actual events.

How do you maintain emotional truth and authenticity with fictionalized accounts of your personal experiences?

And how do you choose which fictional events to replace the real-life ones?

==I think the thing… And with my first novel, what I did was I invented everything that mattered.==

==We're… and everything that I needed. Uh, that was…==

==A kind of, uh… a structure, or the… the… For the setting.==

==Everything would convey the authority of that world in that novel.==

==Was real, everything… in terms of the events, though, was invented, and part of that was.==

==To protect, uh, the people. The real people… whose story I did not want to… It had to be theirs to tell. Does it work?==

==So I was telling a story. That I knew…==

==Intimately… from having experienced.==

==The things that I went through, but I invented all of these.== I invented a scandal.

I invented even a town at one point.

I invented the characters. Because I did not want to intrude on.

On the lives of the people that I went through it with.

Any other questions in the room?

Okay. What time is it? 7 o'clock.

Uh… It'll take a 5-minute break.

Are we on? Sorry.

That was… good. Great.

Oh, it's not invisible. Thank you so much. So… I'm going to share a, uh… a packet of PDF.

Uh, with all of you, uh, through the Police Tube, uh, Asian Arts Initiative, folks.

Uh, that I… of the story that I've been talking about.

With some of the exercises. Um, as well.

Um. That's because the next story I'm going to talk about, which is the party for the Colonel by F.T. Kola.

Is no longer available, uh, through One Story magazine, which was the original publisher of.

Um, it is sold out. Um…

And… this story is written by a former student of mine.

Ooh, I'm very proud of, because the story was… nominated for… was the finalist for the Payne Prize in African Literature.

The first story that she'd ever published, and she wrote it based on.

That family stories exercised. That I just, uh, led you through.

Um, and… I'm gonna read just a little bit of an interview that she did with.

With Hanna Tinti. Where she talks about how it came to be.

So the story, a party for the Colonel is set in the 1970s in South Africa.

During apartheid, um… There's an Indian family at the center of the story that.

As part of… this world in Johannesburg, where… They are both barred from the whites-only.

Parts of Johannesburg. And, uh, also in a different class at the same time from.

Uh, there are Black African neighbors. And so the kernel of the title is trying to raise the family status, uh, through.

Uh, the businesses that… where he is selling insurance. Uh, and… He is being celebrated by his company on it.

Club that would not otherwise admit him. But for this 19, he is allowed to… attend a party there.

And so he's there with his wife. And his grandson.

Whose father, the Colonel's son. Uh… is a political prisoner.

Because he had joined the ANC.

Uh, it tells the story that, uh. I don't think we have seen a lot of, which is partly about.

South Asians living in… South Africa during this era, and the role that they played in the political structure of.

Of apartheid. At the time.

And so 110 asks, what was the seed of this story?

What was the first thing you wrote? And she said. The seed of the story was actually a prompt given to a class I was in by Agnet or Chi.

Which was to write a fictionalized version of an anecdote your parents tell about you as a child.

In my case, my parents often told a story about how, when I was a toddler in South Africa.

We went to a prismet's pantomime at my aunt's high school, which was a mostly white school.

But we are not white. My grandfather had only managed to enroll my aunt there because he could pay the fee.

At this time, my mother and father, unlike my grandfather, were very active in the struggle against apartheid and would frequently take me with them to rallies and protests.

And so when the audience began clapping at the end of the play.

I had a kind of Pavlov's dog response, and raised my fist in the air and shouted.

Which is the… uh, sort of… cryoprotact at the time.

Uh, because it was what I was used to. I can't imagine how quickly my father hightailed it out of that room.

The key to why this story is told is because of the tension between my father and.

And his, uh, father. My father was a young activist, my grandfather was trying to blend into a world.

Into which he would never belong. I had inadvertently revealed his not belonging.

So the kernel character who embodies that place in the world was the central character for me, and I began by writing various scenes of him and his wife getting ready for the party.

Until I figured out it was just easier to place them in the party.

From the start. So, I'm including it as another example, other than how I managed to use my own story.

Um, not just for the bragging light. Because I am very proud of her, but, um… but also because I think the story is, uh, is very powerful in the way that she found her way in.

You know, the… the scene with the child. Happens in the very end of the story. It is, like, the last… the last page of the story where it appeared.

The whole story is about getting us to that place. In a sense.

And I think the… the sort of… power of… What she's accomplished is that she made it about more than just.

Her family, she made it about… the system that her family.

With both, sort of, inside of and excluded, uh. From simultaneously.

And understanding… that being able to tell a story about that, I think, is an incredibly… powerful thing to arrive at.

Uh, through this… kind of anecdote that is very funny that is told about you.

You know. Uh, being able to sense how… how that maps you onto this part of history.

As it were. So… Now I'm going to… Talk next about Dennis Jonathan and Jesus Listbah.

But in…

2000 and…

2017, the year that Dennis Johnson died. I was approached by Playboy Magazine to write a story about.

How he wrote Jesus' time. Uh, which was a very interesting assignment, frankly. Uh, and… Um, because… who knows why, actually. I managed to convince them.

Uh, to both pay me a lot of money, and also… So fly me to Austin, Texas to go into the archives where.

Dennis Johnkin's papers were, and to look at. Uh, his archives, such as they were. They had just been delivered there.

Um… He had begun the process of.

Of getting them to the Ransom Center, and often… Uh, and then after his death, everything else went there, but at the time that I… when to look at is, uh, material, there were, for example.

Bobby did, but no one had looked at. Um, that had who knows what on them.

Uh, it did, however, find… a folder, a Manila folder, with the word collection on it, question mark.

And there were 4 stories inside of it, uh, that were the four… sort of first four stories.

Of Jesus and son. Now.

Part of what you are doing in a kind of… literary, biographical, detective.

Story like that, which is to say, trying to… found out how someone wrote something.

Um. That so many people thought as… I mean, the whole collection… is… iconoclactic, and… iconic simultaneously, right? I think… It was incredibly difficult.

To find, in fact, a literary critic who could say what.

Made the collection stand out, and that was one of the things.

That I found particularly… I'm using, uh… And I kept… I kept finding reviews of the collection.

I would say that the collection had changed everything, but no one would say what it had changed.

And… And I really wanted someone to just… say it, uh, if I could.

And I did manage to… Uh, I did manage to find…

One person. Uh, who satisfied my own sense of what I wanted to find.

So this is a short excerpt from the article.

There is a surprising shortage of good literary criticism on Jesus' son. The initial critical reaction ranged from a publisher's weekly review.

This means that as a fragmentarian, monotonous. Collection 2 Pray from the New York Times, Michiko Kakutani.

Who calls the story's modern-day parables that glow with a strange radioactive light?

The review that shaped Johnson's modern legend came in June 1993, a six-page essay.

By the critic Jack Miles in The Atlantic, Dennis Johnson's path as a writer, from poetry to the novel.

So the short story is as untypical as his vision, but Jesus' son may be read.

Not just as a moment in his evolution, but as a distinctive turn.

In the history of the forum.

Miles makes the case that we would see… we would see.

So often made in later years that Johnson had done something, quote-unquote, deeply new.

He just doesn't say what that is. And so, it seems to me the better way to understand the enduring life of the collection isn't in how it was made.

Perhaps, but maybe in how it is read. May not change our lives to know exactly which of the stories they're autobiographical, but it might change our lives to consider what Dennis Johnson has left us.

The artist and writer Rose McClarion, excuse me. Reviewed Johnson's.

Book in the White Review. 22 years later, and says of it.

His prose retained much of the original chaos of thoughts and feelings, the tone and diction can be moody as a man.

His style can feel more like the charisma of a person than anything else.

Specific, individualized. An unpredictably mutable.

And I think that was part of what. Appealed to me, but I think I asked some short story writers I knew.

How they saw his influence. So, uh… Todd McClanahan said.

I think writers pretend to be influenced by other writers all the time.

But Jesus Dunn is one of those books where the influence of tattooed everywhere.

On our present now. Uh, he wrote expertly about the sensation of being alone in the presence of others.

Does Leopolding for? It's hard to talk about why I like his story. It's a little painful to deconstruct them.

They really are meant to be experienced. I found Johnson's violent contradictions perhaps best parsed by Riyan Amilkar Scott.

Who said, before I discovered Jesus' son. I spent a lot of time listening to Biggie Small's Ready to Die.

Both works strike me in a similar way. I could hardly relate to the service details, the drugs and criminality.

But to the underlying emotion in Small's work, the anger in Johnson's, confusion.

That underscores each story, each word, each image.

And Jesus has done so many of the sentences have a beautiful doubling effect, speaking to the characters and directly to the reader.

==Consolation that we're not alone. In our confusion.

So, I think… You know, when I was thinking about.

There's 11 of them. If you haven't read the collection. Um… There's a narrator who has identified only as fuckhead.

Um, he doesn't tell you his name. And… the drunk and a junkie who spends most of his time.

Looking for drugs. Uh, and… And the last story, he has gotten sober.

Um, there's not particularly an arc. Uh, and… I think part of what.

Struck me is that the book is… it's 150 pages long.

Um, and… Uh, it is still treated so reverentially.

Uh, by… Uh-huh. Generations of riders, not just… a younger generation of riders, but… His peers, uh, and his mentors.

All… they all love this book. No… When looking for how he came to… but… to the stories, uh… I did find an interview he gave.

To Deborah Treismann of The New Yorker.

And it was not available online, but… She did find the recording and send it to me.

Um, and… In it, he talks about how… he had a rule that, uh, if he told stories.

Socially, to other people. He would not write them down.

And then he got very sick, and he needed money. Uh, and he thought, okay, that's a stupid rule, and he started writing them down.

Now, a few days ago. I came across a Substack.

Post from the writer Wes Blake. Studied with Johnson at the Disquiet Writers Workshop.

In Portugal, uh, back in 2000. 14.

And… Dennis said much of what he said in this interview to.

They were trees on them, but he said something else that I found… be more instructive.

Than what I could find at the time that I was writing my article.

Uh, Dennis explained, this is a quote from the… from the post. This explained how the story of Jesus' son came to be. They were all anecdotes.

Things that had really happened to himself and people he knew, stories he told over and over.

Some people always told him he should write these stories down, but he saw them as little more than amusing anecdotes.

==Dennis then told us how he took these anecdotes and created Jesus' son, so that for each short story in the collection.==

==He took two unrelated events or anecdotes and put them together.==

==To create an unconscious question.==

==Now, that's an interesting approach, right? To… writing of it.==

==Dorian and novel, they're often informed by questions. And… when I teach my students.==

==The writing of novels. I will talk about how… chapters… And the passing of a novel.==

==Pacing conviction, how it comes down to… The mix the writer creates of questions asked and questions answered.==

==And if there are too many… questions that are left unanswered.==

==The reader may stop reading. They may feel… quote-unquote, that the pacing has slowed down.==

==And usually what people mean when the pissing is slowed down is they mean that the pace of information.==

==Basically which questions are being answered for them. Has slowed down to a point where they are aware.==

==That something is wrong. That they don't know enough to stay interested.==

==In the story.==

==But creating a single unconscious question to guide a story. Is a very interesting… idea, because… They both suggest.==

==A question in possession of… the reader that is also… possessing the character.==

==Right. Where you're reading to figure out why is this person like this?==

==Um, you may not even know that you have arrived at this question about them.==

==But it develops in the course of the reading.==

==So… That is a different approach to working with.==

==This story that you often tell. Or that is often told about you.==

==But can you use it? In another way, which is to… both, uh… interject material that is unrelated to the autobiographical.==

==Uh, and in the process, create something. New, but also to think through into, like, what could be… the unconscious question.==

==Of the story. Of the novel.==[^11]

How do you… how do you come to that?

Okay, so…

The next story I want to talk about is Mary Gates Gill's story, The Other Place, which is online at The New Yorker.

Uh, it's honestly one of the most terrifying stories that I've… I've ever read. Um… And it impressed me so much at the time that I read it that when I met her.

Which was coincidentally also at the disquiet Conference in Portugal. The year after Dennis was there, 2015.

Um, I asked her how she came to it. And she gave me a very interesting answer. So the story is told by.

A man who is, uh… concerned that his son… might have an unhealthy obsession with violence.

Because of his… love for a violent video game.

Um… And he proceeds to tell… the reader a story about… It's time that he almost killed a woman.

I came up to the act, and then… Proceeded from it.

Uh, and… So I asked her how she came to it, and she said.

Said, well, I used to live in this house in the country.

And, uh. It was located in the center of this plot.

Uh, of land, and all around me were wood. And at night, in the dark, I started to imagine somebody was watching me.

And so I made that fear into a character. That's how I came into the story.

Now. That, uh, was a fascinating twist that is not becoming, as they say.

Um, but I also could see how it works in a way that's similar to.

What I was talking about, in the sense that. It is… taking… a story that you are telling yourself, that you are making up in the moment.

And in the process, you are… frankly, scaring yourself.

Um, is taking that and then making it into a fiction, deliberately.

As a way of taking ownership of it. Taking control of it, if you will.

On working with it to figure out, like. What are you really afraid of? What is happening in the culture that.

And has brought you to this play. Who can you… Who can you imagine?

Uh, in that role. Um.

There's a kind of self-talk. I think this is… this is actually something that… actually takes us into… an interesting… So, I think we're all aware of the MFA, non-MFA divide. We're all probably pretty sick talking about it.

Oh, but there is another divide that is also very interesting that I think is not discussed as much, which is, do you believe that people have.

An internal monologue. Or not.

Like, do you think, in sentences. Uh, do you… talk to yourself in sentences.

When you were thinking, or do you just experience your thought.

As a kind of movement through… images, impressions, memories, associations.

That, uh, may have a narrative to them, but are not.

Articulated in language. And it seems to me the difference.

Is possibly… Like, are you someone who is trying to… control yourself in a public setting.

Where you do not feel comfortable having your own. Kind of automatic reactions today.

Um, or not? Do you… have to kind of be like.

Hey, Alex, now we're going to go to the bathroom. And, you know, uh… Or do you just go to the bathroom? Like, what is your, sort of.

What is your internal process? And then, what is it for your character?

Uh, what is that association you have? Like. Uh, everyone's internal world, in other words.

Are not alike, apparently. And… making room for that, thinking through what those differences might be. There may be more than.

Just the difference that I'm talking about. For example. Um.

Uh, that can be part of how you think about a character.

Have you… come to this place.

So, part of what I like about turning what Mary Gatesville did into a prompt, which would be to take a beer.

That you are basically using the carrier saw. Uh, which I do think of as an abuse of the imagination.

You know, which is to say, like, instead of making a story up that you can tell.

You are just making a story up that scares the hell out of you.

Private theater of paying seats on. Um, so you take that, and you turn it into a story that you can tell.

About what you're afraid of, and why you're afraid of it.

Um. And, uh, if you can hit… I haven't managed to do it yet.

I came up with this exercise, I still have not done it.

Uh, maybe that's my… that's my August homepage.

It resembles… to me, a therapeutic exercise.

That I always thought was kind of creepy. Um, which is, uh…

What do you look like to someone who's spying on you?

When you're home by yourself? Um, I don't remember the therapist who asked me to do this, and… It's possibly because I blocked them out.

But I think about it periodically. Like, if someone was watching me.

Uh, if the person who is, like, assigned to monitor the camera in my computer.

Didn't see me. Sometimes I like to imagine that. Uh, what am I doing?

Usually, it looks kind of like this. Um…

But of course, there's more to it, right? And… that kind of… unsympathetic movement outside of yourself.

Uh… as a way to start writing a fiction. I think is really interesting.

What is the least sympathetic interpretation of what you're doing? When you're alone.

Um.

Uh, the story is online with an interview with Deborah Treasman, as most New Yorker stories are.

Um, that are published. That have been published since her… time at the magazine, uh, and it's a… it's a good interview with Gabe Skill.

Um. Who does not mention the story that she told me.

Uh, but, anyway. That is a tool you can have if you… If you would like to use it.

So, uh, the next story I wanted to talk about is… a different kind of approach to… uh… to a story… The story that I love very much, ==Mr. Canaan by Isabella Hamad.==

==Um, uh, this… was, one, the parents have used Top Prize that year.==

==It was published, uh, in fall of 2017. And…==

==It's interesting to me, partly for the way that it… becomes… The life of a story… Over time. So it begins… By telling you a story about.==

==A young man… who's working at a camp counselor.==

==On the eastern bank of the Jordan River. Uh, after the Six-Day War, and who comes across.==

==Palestine comes across. Someone's body.==

==In a river. And he, uh, manages to… pull this man out of the river, and give him… uh… burial rights.==

==Uh, and… And then… Decades passed.==

==Uh, he tells a story to a friend.==

==And then he and the friend, suddenly are old men. And they're traveling together to… Uh, another country… on a different mission altogether.==

==Uh, they're in Geneva. Uh, they're going to meet the Mr. Kanaan of the title.==

==Um, and… They're both… now they're retiring.==

==One of them is a historian.==

==And… They go to a hookah bar after dinner.==

==And they meet… a young woman who is, uh… descended from the men.==

==But the main character, Sam, married. And so it comes to understand that.==

==In a sense… He has carried this story all this time.==

==To tell her… that this relative of hers perceived the proper burial right.==

==Um, that's… summary does not do Troy Chaptiv.==

==But I think something to examine in the structure of the story is this idea of, like.==

==What is a story? How do we live with it?==

==You know, in talking about these stories that we tell to other people about ourselves.==

==Or about our family, or that are told about us. What might be the last story told about us?==

==Which would be the story of our death. Mm-hmm. Or someone else's.==

==And how… How does that story travel?==

==And where to? Um, that's what we've seen.==

==In the story she's written. If you were trying to turn this into a story prompt.==

==Then, you'd ask yourself. How do you play with time?==

==In the course of the telling of the story. Uh, how do you… You know, most of our stories are about.==

==The lives of the characters. Not so much the lives of the story.==

==What are those stories that. Are constantly told between you.==[^12]

Uh, there was a very interesting way this came up the other day.

In a conversation that I had with. My friend Melissa Thibault, talking about.

The life of a memoir. Um, just to talk to you, Don.

==Um, if you don't know her work, uh. I… it's tremendous, and her new book is called The Dry Season.==

==And we were celebrating the launch. And one of the questions I asked her was, like.==

==Or if I'd like to revisit these stories that you. Have of yourself.==

==And she said, well, it's sort of like… Uh, you know, the way 12 different people will tell a story of the same event.==

==All different ways. She said, but you're the 12 different people.==[^13]

==I thought it was such a… tremendous observation to make.==

==And also… This is another door into another writing prompt, right?==

==Like, what is a story that… That's come to mean different things to you over time.==

==Um… Uh, say if you wanted to use… an autobiographical story.==

==For this idea, or what… Did you invent for a character?==

==That would be a story. That his meaning changes for them.==

==As the years go by.==

Um… Alright, uh, last… So I was hoping to get to Becky Bertha's.

Story in the life, which is a favorite story of mine.

Uh, her last name is B-I-R-T-H-A. Person named B-E-C-K-Y.

Uh, it's just a Black lesbian writer. And she had a couple of… sorry, story collections that came out.

In the first… years of her career in the 80s.

And 90s, and then… Uh, of late, she has written children's books, but this children's book with this story in the life.

Is a story that is anthologized quite a bit. I came upon it in an anthology.

Uh, called Retell Our Sell Stories to Live. Um.

It's a ghost story and a love story. Well, it's a story about being haunted by a lover who has died.

Um, there is… has gotten older.

Um, and…

You know, she was a… Known to most of the world as a butch name, Jing.

But her lover knew her as Pearl. Um.

Uh, privately, and…

I think of this as, like. I've never really read a story like it before. It makes me think of a night when I was with.

A group of writers. We were celebrating a reading.

Alan Gurganis. And I had just given a reading… I was celebrating meeting with Oliver Dana spiritually.

A favorite writer of mine, uh, but… At dinner, our host, Mark Wunderlich.

Uh, so everybody tell a ghost story. Uh, which is a really interesting dinner party game, if you are not freaked out by ghost story.

Some people are. I've actually had trouble teaching goat stories in classes.

Because some people cannot stand to think about it. Have dropped the class.

And so that's why I'm bringing it up. In the last 20 minutes of this class.

Um, but I think something that… I love about this… Story is this idea… of a public self and a private self.

How you are known to the world, how your lover knows you.

Especially the lover who is no longer with you. Uh, and… Uh, what are… the stories that come back to you.

As you are thinking about this live, this is what this narrator is doing.

Um. I think the…

You know, if I had to… if I had to distill this story into a prompt, I think it would be, um… what are the stories that appear… When a lover's ghosts.

Does your name. Just before you wait.

From a dream. If you can give that to a character.

Be part of what is also in here is, uh… a pre-stone wall… view of, uh, Black, lesbian life.

And… this kind of culture of… Which is in thumb… Uh, dressing up, going out to clubs.

Uh, having some drama. Uh, and some fun.

And dancing. And… You know, I think… so part of what you could add into the prompt is, like, how do these stories.

Tell the story of a vanished world, not just between the lovers, but the world that was around them.

How can you offer the reader a glimpse of that? If you are so moved to do so.

Um. It's a… it's a pretty steady movement in the story between.

The president in the past, and she moves fluidly between them.

Uh, the narrator does, that is to say. Um.

There's not a plot to this story. There's Judge.

Uh, the way that… Now, one of the tensions is that they're the young person that is trying to get her.

Talking stories about this place called the Cinnamon and Spice Club.

Which is where she and her lovers go. And she, uh, as she says in the story.

How can she stick that microphone in my face, I can't think of a blessed thing to say.

But all the stories she's not telling this young woman are the stories that she proceeds to tell.

In the story year. And… And I think that's another…

Another thing to think about in relationship to telling a story, which is, like.

Why is the story told at all? Um.

Uh, you know, I was talking, actually, I was chatting earlier today with a friend.

The writers there at Manka Matthews. Um, who's… first novel, I love, desperately, uh, All This Could Be Different.

Uh, we were talking about… intergenerational conversation between activists.

And I was remembering… At the time when I worked with a group of Asian American.

Students at Dartmouth who had a… a student-led seminar called the Militant Asian American.

In 2018. Oh, it's a great experience.

Um, I had a lot of admiration for them. Some of it may identify that I still think about.

As they said, one of the biggest obstacles to. Transformative change was a lack.

Of passing down stories and information from. Older generations to younger generation in the intergenerational.

Conversations that were possible. So there was a way in which.

Uh, even just at the level of the undergraduate student. People were graduating and not leaving their stories behind.

For the students coming out behind them to know. Uh, what was their struggle?

How would they try to make change? How they feed it, how they stumied?

Um. And it seems to me to be, potentially.

A right field for stories, uh, to be told. So I thought I would bring it up.

Uh, in the context here.

You know, uh, and maybe it's a ghost story, maybe it's an activist who's.

Pathon who's calling back to someone who… have some things that they should probably tell before they die.

Um. And… uh… Maybe that could be… different… a different way to approach this. You know, in the… And the kind of literal advice that I gave those students, I… advise them to create an independent blog.

Separate from the way the college maintained. Record so that they could tell stories that they needed to tell, fakely.

In a way that was secure and passed the blog down to the next student.

Those students could do the same. Creating, effectively.

Private blog record.

With this, uh, fictional approach. But I've just come up with. That also sounds really appealing.

Anyway, uh, I will take questions now, as we are pretty close to the end.

Uh, yes.

Have I got to Giovanni's room? So, the bookstore. Oh, I've been… yes.

Oh, okay. I haven't been in a long time, but I… I mean, I think I first went there… That store's been around a long time, right? Yeah.

I guess my up, too. Um… I think I went there in the 90s?

Uh… when I… My brother was in college at UConn.

At the time, and I came to visit him, and I… Went to the store then. I've been more recently than that, but… I don't know if I'll get on this trip, but… Yeah, thanks for bringing it up.

Uh, other question. Anything you want me to clarify?

Questions online?

Yes, hi!

Story of the South? So how does the unconscious question relate to the story of the self vis-a-vis that, uh… Dennis Johnson anecdote.

Right? Um…

Well, that's a good question. I mean, I think… Something that I've noticed, for example, as I get older.

Is that, uh, I see friends struggling with what seems to me to be a problem that they have been struggling with a long time.

And the question is, are they ever going to get the best of it?

And then I wonder, do they think the same thing about me?

Um… And what would… what would that be for me?

Like, what am I, uh… Am I a character in their stories in a way that I don't know?

That I can't apprehend. You know, and I think this is one of the things that's so interesting about writing autobiography, whether you're writing.

Non-fiction or fiction is, like. Uh, will you ever… get to actually see yourself the way others see you.

Uh, there's a… tarot card position in… Uh, the Celtic Cross reading.

Pattern, which is, like, how others see you in this situation that I've always loved.

Precisely because I… I guess I am a Leo. I'm a little obsessed with it. Um… Uh, but it's also part of why I try.

When I am writing nonfiction to interview people about me. You know, I was just… laughing the other day at this story about, um… for 30 Rock fan, you may remember the episode where Liz Lemon.

Realizes that in high school, she was actually, like, a terrible bitch and everybody hated her.

Um, and, uh, her life wasn't at all what she thought it was.

Uh, I… I've had an experience like that, where I ran into someone, and I was very… Like, oh, hey, how are you? And… And he was like, you just… you don't remember that you made my life a living hell.

And I really did not remember. Um… and so I think that is… What are the unconscious question of our lives? That's a really good question, and I think it's… That's what makes it interesting to play with, right? Both for characters, and then also for ourselves, like…

How does a clearer sense of ourselves elude us? Uh, and then maybe how to stop eluding us? How does it suddenly find us?

And in that process, how are we confronted with it? And what do we do?

Good question. Yeah, alright.

Uh, I'm thinking about that… I think about that question, like, why is this person the way he or she is? Um, and you mentioned that, too.

Uh, in your, um, writing, uh. Are you able to, or have you been able to unlock that question about somebody.

For whom do you have that question? Uh… yeah.

Sure. I guess that's a dolly answer.

Um… Question, haven't been able to unlock why someone is the way they are.

Uh, in my writing. Um.

No, I do think that's part of what makes. This kind of work's so exciting.

Is to figure that out about. Other people and about yourself.

Um, I think, uh…

You know, right now, in my… my current work in progress, for example.

Uh, I was… I've… I've written… This will just be between us, you know, all hundred and… 20 or above us.

Um, between the online and the present, but, um… There's a… There's a story that I put in that I did actually have happen to me, where I ran into an ex-boyfriend of mine.

With his new boyfriend. Who was so much like me.

That we were dressed like at the moment we met. And he was like.

Also mixed Asian, like me, and… We were both wearing Method's t-shirts.

In black jeans, and I was kind of like. You got a replacement? Um, and so, uh, it was so funny that I felt like I had to use it, and I'm… I'm having a lot of fun with it. I don't know that I'm coming yet to an understanding of my act.

Exactly, but… I am also… I think I'm interested in this idea that we have a type.

Uh, quote-unquote, uh, and how that… plays out, and that's part of what I'm struggling with now in the current… work in progress, which is a comedy. It's supposed to be a comic novel. Um…

And I'll be interested to see… where I get with it, you know? Um… the… the sort of… the repetition… 40 repetitions cycle is what comes to mind.

But it seems like there's probably a better or more interesting answer than that, but maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's not… Anyway, thank you.

Uh… let's see, here, here, and there. I'm stop.

The, um, risk of tempting the hangman back into your poles, I wonder if you could develop a little bit more, um, your disappointment with Middlemarch. I'm really curious to hear more about that. Sure.

Um. In a general way, I am frustrated by, uh… I'm frustrated by stories about.

Stories where the word unseemly. Comes up, basically, um, because those are my favorite people.

Uh, I'm… like, when I read Henry James.

I always… Always want something dirtier.

I just sort of, uh… I had the same experience when I was reading Ulysses.

It's part of why I can't stand watching. The Gilded Age.

You know, which has some sex in it. And yet, somehow, it seems so boring.

And I just want… I want something, like. Uh, I was thinking about this… Today, I've sort of… flipped over now to reading… finishing this very Slim novel, which is the opposite of Middlemarch.

Uh, which is, like, 800 pages long, 900 pages long, um… uh… it's called Love Lita.

Love, comma, Lita by Mark Hyatt. And it's a remarkable job, and it's another one of these stories that isn't like anything that I've.

Really read, uh, the poet's novel, which is to say that.

It's, um… It's got all these… incredible lines in it, all these incredible images.

Uh, and it's about this… it starts out with this guy who's just walking down the street, and he meets somebody that he thinks it's cute, and he's like.

And they go off and, uh, have sex. For a while, and then it just sort of keeps… Going like that for… I mean, so far, we're, like, 118 pages in, but, um…

But I… And we are getting somewhere with… learning about who this character is and why they are like this.

Um, but he's really… The narrator is really dedicated to.

An idea of, like. The unloving lover.

Like, just having lovers and not being in love, you know.

Um, which is also part of my current… work in progress. Um… So… So that's been fun. I think… you know, my… my problem with Middlemarch is not actually, like.

It's not George Eliot's fault. It's not her responsibility.

You know, uh, she was trying to write about marriage. Um, and the problems of marriage.

Uh, which she did. Um… But what I did, I was like, this was like a white K-drama.

This is, like… 80 chapters to get these people to, like.

Embrace, you know, and you're. I don't… oh, you're almost touching! No, you're not.

You have said nothing. 17 episodes go by, you know, like… Um, so… Yeah.

Uh, are there any online questions? I guess, oh, no, sorry, unit questions. Just so that we can make sure there's a bunch here, we're gonna alternate, so I'm gonna do one, and then I'll edit this one.

This was not a question, just an appreciation of your activism, your teaching, your commitment to justice, and your students. Gratitude.

Um, and how do you know what is the story you are afraid of even telling to yourself?

You mentioned this in some way in your essay collection. How was it for you personally?

Oh, uh, I'm always coming across things that I have, uh, abandoned.

So I guess that's one way. The current novel I'm finishing is one of those.

I took a sabbatical, and I found. Not one, but two novels that I had started and then given up on.

And also forgotten that I've done this. Uh, and so… I don't know if I'm going to finish the other one, I guess we'll see if I do, but I want to.

Um, because part of it is related to that, and it's… Uh, it was inspired by… this time when I was, uh, when I was asked.

By from… members of ACT UP, San Francisco.

To figure out… If someone I was seeing was a policeman.

Uh, and I think that's why I blocked out that particular novel.

I just, at a certain point, it was too painful. To think about. Um… But I also think there's a reason to finish it, and so I will probably figure out a way.

Definition, uh, when I'm done with this one.

We have a question for you.

Um, I was curious about what kind of questions you might ask the tarot when you get stuck in your writing.

Oh, uh… So, the tarot is very good at, uh.

Taking a picture of the present moment that you're in. Uh, and so a good question to ask when you're struggling with writing.

Is to ask the tarot, like, what do I need? To see that I'm not seeing… Uh, or what is the energy that I need to bring into this manuscript, and what is the energy I need to get out of this manuscript?

Um, those are two, I think, fairly good process. Uh, related… questions, but if you don't want to ask a question, which some people are like that.

Um, you can also, uh, give a character a tarot reading.

Um, which I did in Edinburgh, and I used the tarot reading that I got.

And put it in the novel, and then use that to plot the rest of the novel, and that was actually a really successful… use of that tarot reading.

Um, so you can play with it a lot of ways. I think… It's a good idea.

When you invite that energy in to be playful with it.

For sure.

You know, I think… I mean, something else that you can do… without any cards at all, is you can use a tarot card readings positions.

And then answer the questions and the positions for the character.

Or, if you want to use the cards. Uh, use the card.

If that makes sense. So it's like… And by that, I mean, like, some of the questions are, like, what is… what is, uh… passing out of the situation what is coming into the situation.

What is, uh, you know, the… higher consciousness, what is the unconscious?

Hmm. Who are the allies?

Um, hopes and fears. Those kinds of things are… in general, like, um, good questions to ask.

About a character. When you're getting to know them.

Sure. Awesome. Um, what are your thoughts on novels that take more unorthodox style choices, such as being in verse, collage, etc?

How do you make choices around stylistic form, or the vehicle of the story?

Uh, I love… those things.

Yeah. Uh… Someone's asking me, uh, which books I'm going to teach this fall, and one of them is certainly, uh, Autobiography of Red by.

And Carson, which is a novel in white verse that… reinterprets the story of a Greek myth as a love story.

Which is to say. The story of, uh, Hercules killing the red monster Gurion as a love story.

Um… You know, I think we're… Sometimes you're driven to make a stylistic choice just out of spite.

I remember being told that you couldn't write a novel in the present tense, and I was like.

Well, I'm gonna… And then I did. That's called Edinburgh.

Um. So, I think when you're… well, I won't say it's when you're young, because I think you can put a chip on your shoulder at any age.

Um, really, I've certainly learned that. Um.

But, you know, part of it is, like, what's exciting me? What makes… you excited to sit down and write. I think that's part of… part of what can make you… stylistically ambitious, and… If those two things line up, then definitely go for it, I think.

Yeah, there's a hand back there.

Can you hold on for the mic? Yeah, just for the folks on the… You mentioned… oh my gosh.

==You mentioned that when you're writing non-fiction. You interview friends about yourself. What are some of those questions?==

==Oh, uh, sometimes it can just be very… you know, simple, like, do you remember saying this to me? Do you remember this conversation we had?==[^17]

Um, and… Usually, at that point.

I'm technically fact-fast. You know, if I have a way that I remember it.

And I've learned to ask. Um… Uh, some of my favorite… adventures in… back-checking my former teachers, for example, are when.

They have no memory of saying what they said, and sometimes.

What they've said is pretty dramatically significant. Uh, and I've been telling stories about them saying it to my students.

You know, in the meanwhile, Marilyn Robinson is like, yeah, that… Didn't happen.

So I've had to reconcile on, uh, with that. Um… But, uh… But I think the… it's best, probably, to begin simply.

Like, do you remember this? And, uh, and see what happens.

I had a very fun situation where. I was asking these different… activists who all went to this… We had taken in Jay to go to a… amusement park.

And… This was in the 90s, and… It was not a demo. They were not doing a demo. We were just going to an amusement park.

As one of our private citizens. Some of us just happen to be drag queens in drag.

And, uh, and then it turned into a situation when the people at the ticket desk didn't want to sell tickets.

And we're convinced we were there to do a demo. And so we were like, well, we weren't going to do a demo, but now we are.

Um, but then they called the police. Uh, and we didn't want to get erected.

When all we wanted to do was just, like, ride from ride.

Um, but it was interesting… that my friends remember different parks, different drag queens.

The drag queens are remember different events.

It was, like, a… I mean, some parked drag queen, Rashamon.

==Um, on a smaller scale, obviously, but, uh… But that… that was, uh… I don't even know what to do with that. I still haven't finished that piece.==

==Because I just thought, where do I go? I don't know.==

==Some of the gaps were quite. It's… I think what… what I was running into.==

==Is when you ask people a question about something that they have not narrativized themselves.==

==And they did not think it was important enough, eh, to remember at the time.==

==But then they do recall it when you mention it, and so you enter into, like, a… an interesting… place with them together.==[^18]

Question from the chat. Um, we only have. For, like, one or two more. ==Um… How do you steer away from pathologizing your characters, especially when trying to answer questions like, why are they the way they are?==[^14]

Uh, how do you steer away from pathologizing? Um, I think…

==That's an interesting question. I think the, uh… Apologizing is maybe the least interesting answer.==

==The question of why people are the way they are. Um… in fiction.==

==Now, in a clinical setting. Maybe not, right?==

==Um. But… I think we…==

==I don't want to avoid the obvious answers, even as I also don't want to… rely on them.==

==If that makes sense. I don't know if that's helpful. But, you know, when I was thinking through sexual abuse, uh.==

==For the first novel that I wrote. I remember thinking about how.==

==I was trying to write around… the situation of it, which is to say, to think about how different.==

==People had different experiences of it, and to… And to figure out a way… Not so much to include every viewpoint exactly, but to think through.==

==Uh, some of the things that we're uncomfortable to think through.==

==Is I was trying, I suppose, to reach the things that the clinical approach does not reach.==

==And so in that way, I think I… avoided the pathologizing.==

==Does that make sense? And I hope it does.==[^15]

Any more questions? Uh, you mentioned Rashman in your previous response, and earlier you talked about, um, the conversation with the author of the dry season, whose name I didn't catch. Melissa Phibos. Thank you. Yeah, F-E-B-O-S.

Thank you. Uh, and this response of, like, you know. You, as the memo writer, are… the different people. Um… Could you… I'm curious about the context of that, um, like.

Like, was there… what led to that comment? And how did you maybe interpret it?

How did I interpret it? Yeah. And what led to the comment? Um… So, she had written several books now.

Well, more than several, and… And so part of me was wondering… how it was for her.

Since she is, uh… She's not yet 50.

==Um. You know, how do you… And also, at the same time, like, she was not writing about the same situations.==

==In the dry season that she has written about previously.==

==But, you know, that was the context, basically. Has this ever come up for you?==

==How did I interpret it? You know, it, uh, it made me… realize that there are… there are members I have, or things that I think I know about my family, or about myself.==

==And then something happens, or I get a piece of information I didn't have before.==

==And suddenly I have more, a lot more. Uh, the story that I had before, or I have a lot more of a sense of… what the story is that I didn't have previous… Um… And how that's my relationship to that kind of idea.==

==I think of, uh… Stories move approximately two ways, through plot or contrast.==

==And I think of it as being… a way to approach… writing about those things that involves using contrast instead of plot.==

==To tell a story about them. I used to think this, now I know this.==

==For example, which is a very simple structure, certainly. And there's certainly room to do more with it than that.==

==A good place to start.==[^16]

All right, uh… Thank you so much to Blue Stoop and the Asian Arts Initiative.

Thank you, Taylor. Thank you. Um, thank you all for coming.

Thank you all for coming online. They're all saying thank you, thank you. Thank you folks who will see this on the recording later.

Thank you. Awesome. Thank you all so much for getting us to work with the recording, as well as the resource guide that asked.

They feel all the different safety.
