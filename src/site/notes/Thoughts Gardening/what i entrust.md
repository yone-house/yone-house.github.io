# what i entrust

> There is a verse we can recite when planting trees and other plants: 
> 
> *I entrust myself to Earth, 
> Earth entrusts herself to me. 
> I entrust myself to Buddha, 
> Buddha entrusts herself to me.* 
> 
> To plant a seed or a seedling is to entrust it to the earth. The plant will live or die because of the earth. But the earth also entrusts herself to the plant. Each leaf that falls down and decomposes will help the soil be alive.
> 
> &mdash; Thich Nhat Hanh in [*The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching*](https://www.dwms.org/uploads/8/7/8/7/87873912/thich_nhat_hanh_-_the_heart_of_buddhas_teaching.pdf):

i am entrusting quite a lot in building this website--the software, the plugin, all the things the plugin requires, my laptop hard drive, the sites i link to, the internet in general. do these things entrust themselves to me?

these collections will be far more important to me than they are to the things i am entrusting with them. 

i don't know how i feel about that. i don't know how i feel about sharing things on the internet in general. the trust is not reciprocal like a plant and the earth, and so it feels a little weird to call this a "garden."

however, reciting

> *I entrust myself to Earth, 
> Earth entrusts herself to me. 
> I entrust myself to Buddha, 
> Buddha entrusts herself to me.* 

while i make this site 

makes me happy.
