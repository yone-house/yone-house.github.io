# garden design

"gardening" these days isn't perfectly reciprocal, especially if you're using soil in a plastic bag and tools and fertilizer and insecticide, etc.

i think i will dig out & post some readings about garden & landscape design in europe & america. because those origins are what this site feels like&mdash;collecting, taxonimizing, arranging in maybe-artificial rows and groups and rings. 

maybe a priority of mine should be finding a way to let this site grow more organically. will update when i think of a way to do that.
