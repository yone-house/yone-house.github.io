# garden design

i've been drawing a lot on my architectural history education in thinking about this site as a "garden." and i have a lot of thoughts about it.

i was just revisiting some readings from college, about design that has to do with "gardens"&mdash;landscape design in parks, cemeteries, religious and private complexes across cultures & time, "[garden cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement)" and public housing, indigenous gardening and agricultural practices, Modernist "ideal city" designs, etc. etc.

i was also thinking about gardens & parks & natural landscapes that are dearest to me, and how they are laid out.

i am beginning to think i should design this less as the "biome/webring" structure as outlined on the home page, and more as just the kind of garden i would like to be in, with no particular historical model in mind.

one thing i cherish in gardens is ponds/bodies of water of any kind. and the plants that grow in & around them. i am starting to think of these "gardenings" more as ponds now, and if i want to focus more on that i think it would change the structure of this site.

will pond-er and elaborate about what this means in the future.
