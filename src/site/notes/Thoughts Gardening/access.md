# access

i am still figuring out the accessibility basics of this, and as i become more familiar with how this publication works i am always changing accessibility features in this.

i apologize for lack of alt-text and internal linking/ids/ARIA in this site. i am getting to a place of working on it! soon!

however, it's nice that a majority of this site is just very basic text, and should theoretically be naturally accessible and readable. theoretically.

any concerns or comments can be emailed to me at **doorbell@yone.house**
