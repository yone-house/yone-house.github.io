# access

because i don't have full control over this design i do not really know about the accessibility aspects of it, and have to do more testing that i can't really do right now because i don't fully understand how the site is built.

i apologize for lack of alt-text and internal linking/ids/ARIA in this site. i will try to work on it soon!

however, it's nice that a majority of this site is just very basic text, and should theoretically be naturally accessible. theoretically.

any concerns or comments can be emailed to me at **doorbell@yone.house**
