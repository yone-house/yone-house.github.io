# seed banking

one thing i like about Obsidian is that all these .md files are locally stored on my computer and phone, and also on my personal google drive. and now they're stored on github as well. 

a lot of things would have to fail to *completely* erase the content of this site, even if they aren't publicly accessible or prettily styled. there is some kind of... seed banking happening there.
