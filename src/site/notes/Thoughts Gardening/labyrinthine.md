# labyrinthine

i wish i could physically walk through the structure of this site, as seen on the global graph.

i think it would be meditative to physically meander between the pages and look at them as i want&mdash;this site is a nice design for that. it would be so fun to have a physical layout of a website with the pages as nodes and the links as paths between them. and the content on the pages printed out and placed at each node. hmm.

something like a prayer labyrinth. i don't think this site is quite complex enough to be considered "labyrinthine," however, neither are most prayer labyrinths, they're just like concentric circles usually. i know they're used in many cultures but i only know abt the catholic ones. 

concentric circles would be a nice website structure as well :0.

i like labyrinthine walking.[^1] however, re: the prayer labyrinths...:

> Really, the labyrinth is meant to be a mini-pilgrimage, undertaken with prayerful attention. There are examples that are not fads and have survived into the present, such as the annual pilgrimages to St. Patrickâ€™s Purgatory on Loch Derg in Donegal in Ireland. These, however, are penitential exercises and not at all mild meditations in a grassy labyrinth in a retreat house somewhere in the Midwest or on the East Coast of America.

> The labyrinth form is very ancient and penitential in origin, even if those who promote it now are generally allergic to any emphasis on penance or on the need to make reparation for sin. So if you take up a labyrinth exercise thanks to the encouragement of some nice lady religious, keep in mind that your distant forebears took it up in a spirit of repentance and deep self-knowledge. If she is encouraging you along that path, then it is all good. Say the rosary while you walk the labyrinth and then you will be close to the original idea, such as it is lived out in places like Loch Derg.

this is such a crazy piece of writing. perhaps i among the "women religious, in older congregations, who, after having rejected the traditional forms of piety with which they were raised, fix their attention on otherÂ formsÂ while trying to maintain a sense of continuity with the past."

maybe.

[^1]: i have been spending a lot of time in the basement of the Masonic Temple near City Hall & that building is soooo labyrinthine (and you can even walk in many of the walls, so the rooms are like a labyrinth in a labyrinth). however, it is not at all meditative and is incredibly spooky.
