# what i see

i am editing this file as a .md file in [Obsidian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) which i am doing so that i can more easily and naturally post to my website, and easily have some nice features like the graph and the backlinks (provided by the Digital Garden plugin).

writing on this feels like i am just journaling (i do keep my journal in a different vault in this app), and then i press a button and it's out there.

i am using the [LaTeX community theme](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Themes/LaTeX) in my editor as well as on the site, though there's a bit of [custom css for the site itself](https://github.com/yone-house/gardening-at-yone-house/blob/main/src/site/styles/custom-style.scss).
