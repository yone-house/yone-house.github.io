# what i see

i am editing this file as a .md file in [Obsidian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) which i am doing so that i can more easily and naturally post to my website, and easily have some nice features like the graph and the backlinks (provided by the Digital Garden plugin).

> meta moment

writing on this feels like i am just journaling (i do keep my journal in a different vault in this app), and then i press a button and it's out there.

i am using the [LaTeX community theme](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Themes/LaTeX) in my editor as well as on the site, though there's a bit of custom css for the site itself.
