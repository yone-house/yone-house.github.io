INTRODUCTION

\[Object Number **2022.24.1]**

This book simulates **a type of forensics**.

Like **the process of physically excavating an archive, it darts** in and **out of images**, **fragments**, and **documents** with the **eye of** someone **undertaking a search** through a **body that was embalmed and cataloged years ago**. **In this case, it simulates what it is like** to **piece together** a **vision of an entire country and people-the Philippines**, **Filipinos, and by extension** Filipinx **Americans'-through the lens of the American colonial archive**.

***What does*** it ***mean*** to **not *see yourself clearly***\*?\*

My **recent work focuses on** the **problematic construction of American history and how**

**photography informs deeply biased structures foregrounding whiteness as a normative**

**subject. Borrowing** from **the visual language of photography, anthropology, and museum archives, I examine how these disciplines go hand**-in-**hand with producing and proliferating**

**images and documents of exclusion, generating a skewed collection that mirrors** an

**American imagination built on white supremacy, ethnographic record, and cultural**

**Othering**. I **do not make** work **about Filipino identity; I make** work **about** the white **gaze**,

**and those are** two **totally different** things.

**Since 2019, I've used national** archives **and** collections **as visual source material for an**

**investigation** into **the presence (or** non-**presence) of** Filipinos **and** Filipinx **Americans** in **these spaces**. **It's a simple query: *Where are*** *we*, *and **what do we** look like within <b>these</b>*

***American archives? Where are***<i> we</i> not\*\*? *Where are*\*\* *we*\*-accidentally\*\*\*? ***Where should we be?***

**1. For the** sake **of this** book\*\*, I\*\* will \*\*use the term "Filipinx" and "\*\*Filipino **American" sometimes interchangeably to** acknowledge **the existing and, at times**, **generationally different usages of self-identification-Filipinx being a consciously gender-neutral term,** like **Latinx**, **that indicates specific forms of solidarity. It is**, however, a specifically **diasporic invention** not **used in the Philippines. The term "Filipino American" came into** being **during the 1960s along with the larger Asian American solidarity movement**. I **will use "Filipino" to refer to peoples** in and **from the Philippines** who **generally do not** claim **a diasporic identity**-the **majority of the people depicted** in **the** American archives. Like **all cultural groups**, **self**-identification is complex **and nuanced, and no single term** encompasses us all.

**7**

Searching through an archive's documents and photographs to "**find" evidence of one's** cultural lineage and **existence,** it **becomes** clear **that the American** archive **is** not **built for us**, its colonial subjects. **And when the** archive **is about us, it shows a frightening** lack of **clarity**. **If we** were **to take these** archives **as extensions of the American imagination, then that** imagination is full of blind spots\*\*, holes,\*\* and fragments. We **are seen**, posed, and **framed** on **the margins, or as props for** a much-**extended narrative of Manifest Destiny**.

**For** a **project at the Contemporary Art** Museum in **St. Louis in** 2019\*\*, I\*\* spent weeks **investigating archives at the Missouri** Historical **Society** and **the** St. **Louis Public** Library in **order** to **view the ethnographic photographs** produced from **the** 1904 St. Louis World's **Fair**. **Heralded at the** time **as** a marvel **of** American **progress and abundance**, **the Fair also featured** the **notorious Philippine Village**-a type of **ethnographic** "human zoo" **that actively displayed over** 1200 **imported** Filipinos in an unfaithful **recreation of ritual and cultural**

**spectacle. This functioned** to **"educate" the American** public on **their new colonial subjects,**

**as the Philippines had become** a US colony in **1898** and **would** remain **under American rule**

**for almost a half century**. **The overwhelming** amount **of** demeaning **and racist imagery produced at the Fair circulated and became** the most **widely** known **representations** of Filipinos in **the American archive**. **These pictures are everywhere and are** not **countered**, **as**

**they are considered** a **part of the historical** record. **They travel forward through time and**

**keep** on **circulating over a hundred years later**.

**Now** picture **this:** Two brown-**skinned hands** come **together to cover a small grainy black and white photograph** in **such** a **way** to block out **most of a scene. Around these hands** we **can make out parts of the people they** are **covering: a group of dark**-**skinned men** in **"tribal" costume, their bare legs and feet** standing **next to spears, as if posed** for \*\*a picture. Their faces and identifying features, however, are covered by hands-\*\*my **hands-as if to keep them anonymous and protected** from **a public that had put them** on **display**. **It's a curious**

**8**

**re**-**photo that shows and doesn't show at the same time. It withholds and denies and**

**attempts to frustrate the viewer in the act of** looking\*\*. It's one of many, many similar instances\*\* in **which I** physically **used my hands** to **cover and edit the images of** Filipinos **put** on **display at the Fair**. I sat in **the** archives **and systematically intervened** in **their pictorial delivery system**. **The** final **work of covered photographs is** called *Block* Out ***the***<i> Sun</i> **and** was my **way of "talking** back" **to the dehumanization of** this **archive**.

Not **long after**, **I was deep in the Archives Center at the** Smithsonian **National Museum** of **American History, having received a Smithsonian** Artist **Research** Fellowship to **do a** month **of study**, **again** looking **for evidence of Filipinos** in a **national** archive. I **wasn't inter- ested** in **a heritage study**, **where I** would **find cultural** connection **with my** "identity\*\*.\*\*" I **was** attempting **the opposite, which was to see how the empire sees us. Search after search turned up fragments**, **bits, and incomplete evidence**, **as if the** only **way we** could **make it in was** through **ethnographic** photo, **war document**, **or accidental** inclusion. **At one point, I found so few records outside of these spheres that I started** typing **in peripheral terms** like "**Oriental" and misspelled versions of "Philippines" and** "Filipino" **into the search engines**.

**As my frustrations grew, the field of searches grew, the search terms getting wilder and**

**more abstract in order to find something**.

**The Smithsonian searches** took me into the **business records** of **the Duncan Yo**-Yo Company,

**which**, **strangely enough, had one** of the **largest** collections of **images** of Filipinos, **men**

who **had** been brought over in **the 1920s and '30s as traveling salesmen to hawk yo-yos to the general public.** In **the Anthropology archives**, **I found a folder of photographs of** Filipino **Tasaday peoples mixed in** with **indigenous South American Amazonian peoples**, **which had somehow accidentally migrated together** and **become** one **and the same** in **the**

**eyes**  
**of the archivists. There,** I **also found an image** of Philippine **national hero,** author\*\*, and doctor Jose Rizal labeled simply\*\* with **the generic** "**Portrait of** Man\*\*" and handwritten on the side a quizzical "Philippines"?\*\*

9

The hard **truth was that the** empire, **despite** holding **us for half a century, still** did not **recognize** us\*\*.\*\* The colonial **legacy of the ethnographic image was still** the **primary lens, along** with misla- beled **files, untagged records**, **dead ends,** and **fragments**.

*What **do** you <b>do with erasure</b>*\*\*, *disintegration*\*\*, *and **obfuscation***? How ***can***<i> we **re**</i>\*\*-***envision*, assert**\*,\*\*\* and insert ***ourselves***<i> when</i> left **out *of*** *the* original *national **narrative?***

**One of** the **last** photos in **this book shows a black**-and\*\*-white photograph of a group\*\* of **Filipina women** in **traditional dress**, dancing and **joyful**. **It's one of the best images** I could find in **the** Smithsonian **National** Museum **of** American **History that depicts us**. It's an **anomaly**, a blip\*\*, a beacon, a light\*\*. I **was** stunned **when** I found it; it **was so different from all the other images of** "**us." It sits** in an **archival storage box, and the caption for it explains its** origin: "Nationalities\*\*: Eleven\*\* Filipino women in **native dress (from** the **American Counterpoint project**, **Alexander Alland**, Sr., **Photoprints**, circa 1940, **National** Museum of **American History,** Archives **Center,** NMAH.AC.0204)."

**The** lengthy title of this **artwork places it** within a **specific index of an American** archive. **You** can track **it back**. The **call** numbers **show the** image **as being officially logged** into **a**

**shelf** of **history,** a moment **where these** women can **be called** forward to **attest to their presence**

in **a sea** of non\*\*-representation\*\*. If **we** look **closer** at this image\*\*, we\*\* can **see that it's actually a picture of a taped**-**together picture-the original photograph by Alexander Alland** Sr. sitting in

a **box** on a **table, was photographed** by **me and** blown up and printed in **pieces as low-resolution**

**LaserJet prints, complete** with **cut edges** and overhanging **paper** margins\*\*. These pieces were\*\* then **literally Scotch**-**taped together** into **a** giant **poster**, **pinned** to my **studio** wall, **photographed yet again, and then finally printed as a** high\*\*-resolution large-scale archival print and framed\*\*. **It's a reproduction that has gone** through multiple **processes of reproduction**, from low **resolution** to **high resolution,** from **the belly of the archive, buried and forgotten in boxes** and **stacks, to** a **new art object**.

**10**

**11**  
It **has** also recently **been** acquired by **the** Smithsonian Museum **of** American **Art**, having migrated out **of** an archived **box** from **the** Smithsonian National Museum of **American History**, **originally as a** work **by** Alland, a **documentary photographer, and retold as an artwork** by me, a Filipinx **American speculating** on **her own place** within a **national narrative**. **I see** this swapping **of origins and histories as a** form **of regeneration**, a nod **to the legacy of Alexander Alland, a Ukrainian**-**born Jewish refugee whose life's** work **included documenting immigrant** communities in **America to** counter rising **xenophobia**. His **picture, reflecting** us, **brought me profound** light, **and** I, in **turn**, bring it to **light eighty years later through reproduction**, **com- pressing time and distance between** us. **Together, we get to sit** in **solidarity as dual authors** in a \*\*new spotlight-\*\*not **hidden away**.

**Just yesterday, I did a search** through **the** Smithsonian online **database for the term** "Filipino **American," and** I **found myself** in the archive **through this new**/old work, **clearly labeled**. It is **Object Number 2022.24.1**.

**Note: The descriptors and** caption **information notated on archival documents reflect the terminology** of **the time, betraying colonial language** and **anthropological terminology, as well as inaccuracies**. **Rather than correct them, I leave them to show the structure of the language of the archive, and how they appeared to me.** In **a few cases, I include notations that complicate or attempt** to **draw out more context**. It **is an invitation.**

"How do you talk back to **the** archive\*\*?"\*\*

*By*  
***"talk back" I mean: How are you interrogating*, <i>borrowing</i> from**, *manipulating*, **departing** *from*, utilizing, *changing, **resuscitating**, reorganizing, <b>reinterpreting</b>*, *and **perhaps even** speaking* **out** or against it? *What **motivates** you* to **do** *this* work\*? What **methods**\* **do you *use?*** *What does* **it *feel*** *like* to *work* in *archives*\*?\*\* What **are** the **unexpected pleasures**\* **or *traumas that*** can ***arise from***<i> this **process**? What <b>project</b></i> **or *projects* do you** want to ***share? What*** archives ***have you mined***<i> and why? **What**</i> **is *at stake for you*?**

**This was the** proposition I sent to nine working **artists whose** unruly **practices I respect** and

**admire. I've followed their research**-based **work for years, and their responses evidence deeply** thoughtful **practices that** complicate, counter, **and engage the question of working within archives**.

**Carmen** Winant **shares the anxious pleasures** and **political problematics of** feminist **archive excavations**, **while Astria Suparak argues for how historical material** can **speak** to **a more equitable** vision **of a future. Gelare Khoshgozaran describes a tactic of refusing the archive's power in order** to push **beyond it, and Jason Lazarus presents a textual poetics** that **lyrically reflects** the **process of sifting and searching. Savannah** Wood **shares the history of an African** American **newspaper birthed** from **familial lineage** and shows how **an archive made *by* a** community ***for*** **the** community **creates a powerful legacy**. Wendy **Red Star breathes** story and **life** into **Native objects and artifacts** held in **institutional collections, repairing connective tissues** once **formerly closed off, and LJ Roberts** pulls **ghosts** from **the** margins **of microfilm**, **finding queer trans** kinship and **fierce** beauty. **Finally**, Minne **Atairu trains** AI\*\*-generative algorithms\*\* onto Benin **Bronzes and the colonial archive to create visions of possibility, while Pio Abad exhumes a dictator's legacy to actively fight** ongoing **political erasure and amnesia in the** Philippines.

**Their profound contributions to** this book link a **wide variety of practices** in **and** out **of archives-** all **under an umbrella of a sense of urgency** and **investment**--**and for that, I am deeply grateful**.

***Forwards*** through *the* archive, **not** *backwards*.

CARMEN WINANT

***Speak***, archive

**Carmen** Winant's **practice makes inquiry into feminist histories.** With **a particular interest** in **methods of social network building-and an emphasis** on **multiracial**, **transnational, and intergenerational exchange and inheritance-her work prompts the question: how are feminist coalitions built and what is the larger function of imagination in the process of liberation struggle? Photography operates in Winant's work as both a tool-an expository mechanism that** holds an \*\*idea-\*\*and **a meaningful subject**. **She is interested** in **how revolutionary social** movements **utilize picture**-making **and its dissemination** in **service of information sharing and alliance building**.

**57**

Am I an "archives **artist," as I** am\*\*, in fact\*\*, **called**? Why **does the** term **feel so ill** fitting? Perhaps it **sits** too **uneasy with** my **former self**, who **would have found the label conservative**: when I first began to **work** this **way,** I **made a silent pact** with **myself that** I **would never** step **foot** in institutions\*\*, that\*\* I would be an **artist** who **created** only **"outlaw" archives (as I thought** of them)**, assemblies of found** and **appropriated material that were otherwise atomized, free** floating in the world. I **spent** months, and **more often years,** working **to collect around a theme or experience** with **this method-ripping images out of books, magazines, and other printed material-not always** knowing **where** I was **headed**. My most well-known work, *My* *Birth,* was\*\* made in this **way,** but **so were many other**, **lesser**-known **projects. This felt** to me to **be a** political\*\*, even\*\* punk\*\*, way to operate\*\* within (or without) archives, by moving **around the** Special **Collections gatekeepers**. I **was** to **decide what would enter my collective record**, **and those** things **were** almost **always funky,** shitty, and **highly** acidic photographs on **paper-evidence of radical**

feminist movements\*\*. Outlaw archives for outlaw histories\*\*.

**As I deepened** into **this work**, I **encountered the** obvious: **there** is no **escaping the violence**

**of archives** (**I also encountered the realization that such violence, and harm-making,** is not

**metaphorical**). **I'd dedicated myself** to outlaw **archives**, **naively, to** circumnavigate this problem, to fill in **the gaps**. But some **holes** are bottomless. **Even, and perhaps especially**, in **assembling my** own archives\*\*, the\*\* omissions in **subjective experience** can **be** so **profound**. I **wrestled** with My Birth\*\*-a project\*\* for which I **was able to source** only **a** minority **of** images **of** women **of** color, **of surgical** birth, **of queer couples-as I** was making it. **I debated** if I should **show it at** all, and my **responsibility** to not **reinforce white supremacist,** heteronormative value **structure as it comes** to making and having **our babies**. In **the** end, I did **show that work**. And I **also** spoke about **these** exclusions **everywhere** and every **time I could**, **including on the wall label and in the** one-minute audio **guide. I** worked, in **other** words, to **center and vitalize that** struggle as **the work**, not **as the** problem in its **way**, or **the** issue to **be swept** under **the rug**. It **is an imperfect** and **nuanced** solution, and one **I** am **still** reckoning **with and** evolving.

CTCTERS SCRAPBOOK

After that project, and all **it revealed** to me, **I did** begin to **step** into institutional **spaces, if** tentatively **at first**. I worked in university archives, **historical societies, museums**'  
**papers**.  
I did so while continuing to assemble my own **catalog** of found **images-sometimes blending the two, not so exclusive as I once thought. And new paths have emerged (archives are like that, always opening trap doors). In the last few years, I have begun to work in close collaboration with feminist organizations and the women who run them-domestic violence advocacy and support organizations in Philadelphia and Denver, abortion clinics across the Midwest-which has been an education in trust building and reciprocity. It is a reminder for me, after** all those **years of** working alone in the studio, that there **are** no **social movements**, and no **archives of those** same movements, without **solidarity**. Without **people**. **And**, for my **part as** an **artist**, **there** is no work **about care** work without **the conditions of care. The** relationships that **have** come from this work have **been** among the most meaningful **of my life**, and **the engine for** all that follows. This **is the real** animating **force of** archive work for me\*\*:\*\* in **dealing** with **objects** that belong to **others,** we **are** drawn **closer**.

ASTRIA SUPARAK

We, the **Aliens** of the Future

Astria **Suparak is an artist and curator based in Oakland, California. Her cross- disciplinary projects address complex and urgent issues (like institutionalized racism**, **feminisms and gender, and colonialism**) **made accessible through a popular culture lens,** such **as science fiction movies, rock music, and sports**. **Straddling creative and scholarly work, the projects often take the form of publicly available tools and databases, chronicling subcultures and** omitted **perspectives**.

**65**

ANDUCA

The future brings me to the archives\*\*.\*\* Specifically, **the** endless depictions **of an Asian future** eerily drained **of** Asian people\*\*,\*\* as envisioned by white filmmakers. I've assembled **a** taxonomy' **of** the objects and **tropes** conscripted for **these** insidious **stories,** which **drives my research** into the **arts,** architecture, design, fashion, food, languages, **and** weaponry of East, **Southeast**, **South**, Central\*\*,\*\* and **West Asian cultures**.

My main motivation with **this** work is to elucidate present\*\*-day racist stereotypes and their\*\* historical antecedents. These noxious fantasies and **fears, when visualized** and **normalized** by popular culture, influence not just American society but are globally exported through **the juggernaut** that **is** the Hollywood film industry. Studying the history **of** anti-**Asian** legislation and violence—**and** the dehumanizing and demonizing **mass** media **depictions that** lead **up** to these moments-**is** grim and infuriating work. In (white-dominated) experimental film circles, mainstream **movies** and the Academy Awards **are disregarded** as frivolous and inconsequential, and **in the art** world, as low-brow and lightweight. But these omnipresent films and TV shows **have** real-world consequences. They **spread the** contrived history **of** an \*\*all-\*\*white **Europe of** yore, which fuels white supremacists and anti-immigration ordinances. And they embed the wicked myth **that** non-white cultures-particularly Indigenous, Brown, and Black \*\*people—\*\*are too stupid and incompetent to have invented monumental architecture and **sophisticated** public infrastructure, **therefore** making **acceptable the** ludicrous conspiracy theory that **many of** the **world's greatest** wonders were built by extraterrestrial aliens. This **is** echoed in the **successful** campaigns against affirmative action and DEI (**diversity**, equity, and inclusion) programs, and **the skepticism** that people **of color** haven't truly **merited** their laurels.

My **second** goal is to highlight lesser-known histories **of** Asian creativity and brilliance. This **repairs two** gaps\*\*: the\*\* personal, **as a** second-generation immigrant from a lineage **of orphans**, **refugees, assimilators, divorcees, and** abandoned and/**or** estranged people who can't or **won't** share **details of our past**; and **the** (American\*\*)\*\* cultural\*\*,\*\* primarily public education and popular culture. With Ancient Sci-*Fi* 2, I created backdrops of fourteenth- to twentieth-century cultural materials (including manuscripts, paintings, **tapestries**, furniture, and architecture) from across Asia that contain **concepts central to** present-**day science fiction** and fantasy\*\*.\*\*' I intentionally **selected** images **that were** public domain, **copyright free,** or **under a** Creative Commons license to ensure that the whole **set could be downloaded for free and circulate** more easily.

67

I **deliberate** about who **and what** to name **and cite. Within** my **performance lecture Asian** *futures*, *without Asians*," I don't **waste** time verbally naming **the** white **directors** and **actors or** shoring up **their** name **recognition**, but **I** purposefully identify the **Asian artists and talent**, who **are often relegated** to **brief** and cartoonish **appearances.** I'm also pointing out and naming **the specific** Asian-derived **clothing articles,** ornaments, armaments\*\*, and artifacts\*\*-**frequently used** incorrectly, inappropriately\*\*,\*\* and\*\*/or\*\* under **the** label **of another** ethnicity\*\*-as\*\* well **as specifying** the traditions to which **they** belong.

**Much of** my **current** work **makes** connections **across** distinct **groups** for **possible solidarities**: **Pan-Asian** (not **narrowed** to **East Asia, as** that **term** is **typically** construed in the United **States)**, the tropical zone, the Global South, and **populations** with **shared histories of exploitation** and **colonialism**. We will not **be separated** and isolated in **the present** or **erased** from the future. And **archives are** key **to this**-**investigating**, **correcting**, **activating,** supplementing\*\*,\*\* expanding, and **reimagining the** archive.

***More Poetics***\*\*, *Less* Forensics\*\*

***Gelare Khoshgozaran*** **is an undisciplinary artist and writer whose work engages with the legacies of imperial violence manifested in war and militarization, borders**, **and archives. They use** film **and video to explore narratives of belonging outside of the geographies and temporalities that both unsettle our sense of home and make our places of affinity uninhabitable.

While  
**any speech act is relational**, *talking back* is premised on **the imbalance of power** in **the** relation. *Talking back* at *the **archive*** **is a response to the archive as the location** of **power**. **Whether** through a **small gesture of protest,** an **intervention** in **the archive, or a material taking** back, *talking **back*** **at the archive** is an **attempt to reclaim that power**. **Similar to reclaiming** "the **right** to look," **it is** a rebellion by **enunciating** a **subject** who **"refuses to allow authority to** suture **its interpretation** of **the** sensible to domination, **first as law and then as the aesthetic."**

**The histories** I **engage** with in my **practice, and** I **see as materially** and **aesthetically formative** to **my present time**-**life, are** of **destruction**. In the wake **of conflicts, wars, occupations**, **revolutions**, **even family feuds and** romantic break **ups**, **destroying the evidence of** a (**shared)** life **serves as negative** proof that **there never was** anything worthy **of preservation**. **Conflicts are documented and archived** in what **has been destroyed** (lost\*\*)**. In my work, I've been looking for ways to open up this question, against the enclosure of archives and their logic of inclusion or exclusion, fabrication, or reconfiguration. They are always so massive that, in the end**, the work becomes about them\*\*. **They're seductive, and their lure is in their** mythical **arbitrariness as much as their material order and architecture.** I **often** visit **archives to remind myself that there** is nothing **there to see and that the document (evidence) has already been destroyed**. **The visit then becomes the** main **act of research**, **a ritual of sorts, which shifts the location of knowledge** from **the site of the archive to the sighting of the archive**. **Visiting** is a **way of** turning **the** body into **its** own **archive of experiences and emotions for me:** going in **and retreating**, **immersing and retrieving**, **retaining and reflecting**.

JASON LAZARUS

LOWERCASE: **artists and** archives\*\*\*\*\*

Jason **Lazarus** is an **artist exploring vision and visibility**. **His work includes a range of** fluid **methodologies**: **original, found and appropriated images, text-as-image**, photo\*\*-\*\*derived **sculptures made collaboratively with the public, live archives, LED light images, and public submission repositories,** among **others**. This **expanded photographic practice seeks new approaches of inquiry, embodiment, and bearing witness through both individual and collective research**.

**135**

i never studied archives as a student, and **as with a lot of** things, coming **in as** an outsider helps and can feel liberating.

my  
best archive projects have **started** from curiosity\*\*,\*\* confusion, **and vulnerability;** my **most** rapid growth in archive-making came from a **project that** was built from emotional **need**. emotion **is a** north **star for artists and** is **especially under**-tapped in **the** making **and critical** reading of **archives**.

**as** emotions **are messy,** we \*\*encounter another lesson-\*\*organization can be **the downfall of** an archive, and messiness can be **a strength**. in some **projects,** after **newly installing** work for exhibition, i count on the **images/objects** in **the installation being** sent back to **me later** in

**new** random **orders that** become a starting point for the **next** public **iteration** (**i** call this **archival** slippage). the altered work then asks **for** listening **and** reading anew-if i **renounce** control, **i** can **feel** the shock of **the** new.

**\*archive is a term and** practice **that needs** continual **renewal**-it should be used and **abused**, **challenged** and **reimagined**. artists **are** uniquely **situated** to bend, break, and **evolve their** language, **forms,** methodologies\*\*...\*\*

with **another archive, i realized** that it **was better** to make **the objects vulnerable** and **easily**

**stealable,** and **a few were**.

how can **an archive** embody **the interior** world **of its maker?**

when **frustrated** by **the** limits **of *feeling*** in photography, notions **of** framing **I learned** from studying **photography were** formative to working with **archives**. working **beyond photographic series and** into nebulous bodies **of images (or** image-**objects) creates something** that **feels**

more **oceanic**.

**creating basic** collecting **contours** (like one **does** when composing **a** photograph) **for a** collection allows unexpected feeling and critical meaning to wayfind in and out without me having to know **each step**.

when my **practice became more about listening**, and needing to listen carefully, working with **archives came more naturally**.

**137**  
CV TICO  
how can an archive give more **than** it **takes?**

the temptation to **correct** an **existing** archive can **sometimes be better faced by** making an archive from scratch-a **very** subjective **and idiosyncratic** place **that official archives** may not access. on **the other** hand, **reading official archives** from a **particularly subjective and** idiosyncratic **place** can be where we find a **sense of redemption**.

**my** archive **practice is always made** thinking **of the** word in **lowercase, with the hopeful** emotional and **intellectual effect** being **uppercase *Archive***.

i think **of archives as** monuments **that** can **be fluid**, **transportable, searchable**-**gaps** can define **them and become** meaning **as well**.

one thing **i've learned** most from **making** archives: i am constantly seeking the **marginal and** asking it to **perform as** the center. **when** i'm in **official archives, i** find **myself staring at elements** that **were** not **meant** to **have** critical meaning\*\*, marginalia,\*\* support **structures**,

incidental **marks, and notations**.

**the** (orthodox) **collecting logic of** a ***genizah***\*\*, a Judaic archive\*\* spanning multiple **centuries**, **was**, for **me, revelatory. a *genizah* is anything** with **god's name** on it\*\*, from a prayerbook\*\* to **a scrap of a document**, **that** can **never** be **destroyed but rather is retired.** it's a **deep historic algorithm** in **which the sacred carries the profane** without end (a **treasure trove for researchers of** all **kinds)**. it **also proves collecting logics are** just one **way to read** archives; **they can** lose **meaning and be subsumed over** time\*\*,\*\* sometimes for **the best**.

my compulsion **to collect is a form of love-a belief that everyday objects radiate greater possibilities of** bearing witness **and present**/future meanings.

the most **interesting** thing about **archives has** nothing to do with archives-it's **their** capacity **for** (in)**humanity**.

**archives are** profound and violent-like any good poem, everything is **at** stake.

SAVANNAH WOOD

*Martha's **Hand***

***Savannah Wood*** **is an artist with deep roots in Baltimore and Los Angeles**. **Wood** works **primarily in photography, text, and installation to explore how spirituality, domesticity**, **and our relationships to place shape our identities. Her projects reconnect people with the everyday beauty of our world and the histories that lie hidden below the surface**.

**As the Executive Director of Afro Charities, Wood is creating infrastructure to increase**

**access to the 131-year-old *AFRO American Newspapers***' extensive **archives**.

SY JUCO  
RI IND SPOT

143

During **the past** four **years,** I **have been immersed in the** *AFRO* American Newspapers' **archives**. As **Executive Director of Afro Charities,** I am **charged with caring for the** collection **and** making it **more publicly accessible**.

**The *AFRO* has been** in print since **its** founding in **Baltimore** in **1892. It is the oldest Black- owned business** in **Maryland and the** third **oldest** in **the** United **States. The archives include approximately three** million **photographs, several thousand letters, rare** audio **recordings**, **original political cartoons, and more than a century's worth** of **business records** among **other**

**materials** from its **thirteen** editions.

As **a descendant** of **the AFRO's founders,** I often **find** myself lingering **a** bit in **the** "**Murphy**" **section** of **this collection, pulling files** from **the many boxes that line those shelves**.

When I **first moved back** to **Baltimore** in **2019,** I'd **been** thinking **about the *AFRO's*** origin story\*\*. As\*\* I'd **been** told, **Martha Howard Murphy lent her husband**, John \*\*Henry Murphy, $\*\*200 to **buy the *AFRO* name and** printing **press at an** auction. **The** *AFRO* **became prosperous**. **Our family still owns and operates it**. **The** end. **Nuance was hard to come by,** and **every state- ment of fact led** me to more **questions**.

**Where did that initial money** come **from?** How **did Martha, a formerly enslaved Black woman**, **have that much disposable cash** (**several thousand dollars** in **today's** money\*\*) at the turn of the twentieth century? I shelved these questions in the back\*\* of my mind, adding **them to** a running **list of research curiosities that** I **would get around to when I had time**.

**But Martha intervened**.

One afternoon, **I lifted the lid of a clamshell box-an** anomaly **among the 1500 records boxes that form most** of **the collection-to find the clearest image I had yet encountered of my great-great-grandmother. There she was, tucked away in her funeral scrapbook,** with a full **obituary pasted next to her** image.

145  
S. SYJUCO  
BLIND SPOT  
More facts emerged. She **was** born **enslaved** in Montgomery County\*\*,\*\* MD. **Her father** died **a wealthy** farmer **and philanthropist**, **a far cry from his early adult life as the** human **property of slave traffickers** with prominent family names. Upon **her father's death**, **Martha received** land, which she **ultimately sold to her** brother\*\*,\*\* providing **her** with **the** funds **to purchase the** AFRO. Martha **was a** co-founder of **Baltimore's Colored** YWCA (CYWCA\*\*) and its president\*\* for nearly twenty **years**. Letters **of condolences** from **fraternal organizations and Black news- papers across the country lined** the remaining **pages of** this **scrapbook, confirming just how greatly respected she was** within and outside **of Baltimore**.

**Since that** fateful **afternoon**, **I've** come **to recognize Martha's** spirit guiding my **day**-to-**day work.**

**By** following **the threads unspooling before me,** I **made** my **way** to her place **of** birth\*\*-the land that also birthed the\*\* *AFRO.* **Research** into **Maryland's** public **records revealed that the land she** and **her family had** been **enslaved** on, then owned, **was now owned** by **the State** of **Maryland**. I **reached out** to **Maryland's** Department of Natural **Resources** right **as they were** submitting **two grant proposals** to **restore the remaining structures on the** site and to **docu-** ment the land's **history,** connecting it to **the** living **legacy of the *AFRO***.

**The grant proposals were successful, and** work will **start** soon to blaze the **Howard Family African American Heritage Trail**, **which** will bring visitors into **the** world **of** Enoch **George Howard** and **Harriet Howard**-**Martha's parents. Visitors will** learn **about our family's journey** from **enslavement to** self\*\*-emancipation and\*\* subsequent **leadership on the** local and national **stage for the cause of** civil **rights**.

Through **this land**, I've **connected** with **cousins near and** far, who, unbeknownst to me, **have been meeting** for annual **family** reunions **for the past** thirty-plus years. I've started making art about this **story**, **including a forthcoming experimental** documentary that took me to Niagara Falls and Chicago, **tracing our family's diaspora** from this **former** plantation. Two cousins I **interviewed spent summers** on this land as **late as the** 1960s.

147

**The deeper** I go, **the** clearer **Martha's image appears to me. After returning** from Chicago,  
I found **two new photographs of her, including the first I'd ever seen of her as a** young **woman**. Soon **after that, an** Afro **Charities board member sent me a** link **to an auction** on **eBay for a commemorative plaque carved** with **a relief of Martha's face that used** to **hang** in **the CYWCA** building. At **every turn**, **she shows up as if to say,** "**Don't forget about me."**

**For 131 years**, **the *AFRO* has persevered** as **a trusted source of news and** a **mirror to its** community\*\*, reflecting back\*\* our **struggles, joys**, **and everyday lives**. **Thousands of families are represented within this archive of Black life alongside chronicles of public civil rights battles and more than a century of world news** told from **Black perspectives. Every August**, **when** we **celebrate the AFRO's anniversary, I am struck** by **how Martha's gift of** $200 **has afforded us this resource**. **Her and her husband's investment**, vision\*\*, and labor have shaped the lives of generations of people who may\*\* never **know their names. Through successive generations** of **our family, we've built** on **this legacy, using the tools available to** us to **push** this **project forward**.

**As a steward of** this **archive,** I am working with a **small** but **fiercely committed team on the** intensive **labor of processing the collections, digitizing their photographs, and building** a **permanent repository and research center for the public in Baltimore**.

**As an artist and descendent**, I'm **constantly searching for the nuance** in **my ancestors' experi- ences**. When I **hit a wall sifting through archival records**, I **lean** into **other ways of knowing**: working with **ancestral astrologers and spirit mediums; traveling to relevant geographies to smell the air and see how the light falls; botanical research** into **the average age of walnut trees; oral histories with extended family; and anything else that might bring** me closer **to my ancestors**' **interiority. The archive serves as an entry point that can generate as many questions as it answers. Our curiosity brings these collections to life**.

FIGURE/**GROUND** STUDIES

I've always been interested, curious, a questioner who wants to know the details of the history of my community\*\*, the\*\* Apsaalooke.

One of the most powerful experiences I've had in an archive was during a Smithsonian **Artist** Research Fellowship at the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI\*\*) in\*\* 2019. I had started accessing museum collections with Apsaalooke **materials** around 2014. Since **then,** I've worked in **several** museum collections **that** hold Apsáalooke **cultural** possessions. **This** Smithsonian **visit was different**: it **was the first time that I encountered** records **attached** to objects **with** names **of my ancestral relatives**.

**There's** this **sense** when I go through **collections that have my ancestral community's** possessions\*\*,\*\* of knowing **the designs**, **the objects**-I **can feel intuitively that these materials are** my community's. **At** NMAI, for **the first** time\*\*,\*\* the **names of my second great-grandfather Bear** Tail\*\*,\*\* fourth **great-grandfather** Green Skin\*\*, and second great-grandmother Julia Bad Boy were attached\*\* to **objects** and **photographs that** I **could hold in my hands.** Knowing **that** my ancestors **once wore these accessories** and **interacted with them felt purposeful. For me,** being in **the archives is emotional** work, **and** in **being open to that** emotion, **in letting it guide** my **process**, **I felt, and** continue to **feel**, like **I was supposed** to be **doing that** work\*\*, that\*\* I **was** meant to **be there**.

**There is a** beautiful buckskin elk tooth **dress** in the NMAI collection **made by** an **Apsáalooke**

**woman named** Nellie **Scratches Herself**. When I **encountered Nellie's dress in the collection**,

I **marveled** at **her design choices, the subtle** and **delicate shifts** in **colors of seed beads she used** to **accent the arms** and **the yoke of the dress**. **I thought** to **myself, "This woman is a master of aesthetic**." The **dress was** stunning: it **was simple** and **classic in** its **design and neatly tailored** in **technique.** I **photographed and** took measurements and ran my **hands down the** length **of the dress** looking **closely** at **her attachment** technique **for the** elk teeth. I looked **inside the dress, and I** put my **hands** inside **so** I **could examine the shoulders that she** adorned with **pale** blue pony **beads that started at the yoke and continued down the tapered sleeves**. Nellie **even beaded the yoke's opening** with **powder** blue **beads**, **a technique I'd** never **seen before. I've seen the yoke lined** with buckskin **or fabric,** but **this was the first** time I'd seen it **beaded**. It **was delicate**, it **was** feminine\*\*, and it struck\*\* me **as very** caring **and** thoughtful. I fell in **love with the** buckskin fringe **that outlined the** underarms **and** down **the** seams **of the dress**

and **the** bottom **hem**.

**189**

The next day, in **the** photo archive\*\*,\*\* I came across a William Wildschut photograph of Nellie Scratches Herself astride a big bay horse and wearing a beautiful buckskin dress and beaded floral gauntlet gloves\*\*. Nellie\*\* was sitting tall, her legs were covered in a dazzling patterned trade blanket\*\*,\*\* and **her** facial expression reminded **me** of all Apsáalooke women and girls when getting ready to parade-you want **to get it over** with! She was leading another bay horse, and it looked like she was ready **to** go somewhere or **had** just returned **from an event**. The photograph was taken between 1917 and **1928**, and the description stated: Nellie's **father** *was* Scratches His *Face; her mother* was ***Bad Buffalo*** Woman. She was **recognized** by the Indian Census as Nellie *Scratches and Nellie **Buffalo***. ***Later she*** **married *Joseph*** J. Pickett.

I take **pause** and think about **Nellie's dress**, **and I** think about **my experience today** in my community and how community **members can** tell who **the maker is of certain cultural items**. **People** in **the** community bring **their own signature to these cultural items that represent the** Apsaalooke **aesthetic, and they** become well **known for the work they make**. **Community members** will **say, "If you want a** buckskin **dress, you** should **go see Linda, or if you want a beaded belt,** you **should** ask **Lance**, or Amy **makes the best shawls you should go see her." I personally** can point out **any beadwork** by **James Takes Enemy or** my **grandmother's famous floral** shawls. Nellie certainly **was one of these** known people in **the** community **during her** lifetime\*\*.\*\* I imagine someone saying, "Go **see** Nellie\*\*, she really makes\*\* good **dresses." Perhaps I might run** into something of **Nellie's** in **another collection and** know **it is hers because of the thoughtful delicate feminine touches**, that simple beaded **yoke**. **I feel** like I **now** know **more about Nellie through her dress and photograph, and** I might make **that connection should** I **ever see** another **dress.**

191

These are the moments that I **cherish** the most. When I find those connections in the archives, an object is no longer an object-it's full of life and personality and **you** see the powerful  
behind that object. You remember **that these** archives are human and **they** have person information to share **if** you take the time to notice\*\*.\*\* Seeing **faces, seeing** names\*\*, especially\*\* women's names\*\*, that's\*\* the good **stuff**, that's when **I feel** grateful.

One question that is asked **of me** is how I **feel** about **these institutions that have** my community's possessions. I'm never able to answer that **question**. I **feel** too **many feelings**: I **feel excited** to **see what they have**, **I feel anxiety, I feel like this is** my one **chance to see these materials**, **I feel sad**, I **feel** conflicted, but most **of all I feel that** I **need** to **make the** most **of these** visits. I can **share the** voices and the **knowledge** from **these possessions kept** in **these vaults, on these shelves,** tucked **away** in **cabinets miles away** from **their origin, from their** community.

**I** can become my **own** archive. I can **be the** archive **for** those **objects that** are **hard to access**. **I** can **be a resource**, and I can **share** in my unique **way of** learning **through my art**. **When** I'm **gone**, I will **become** the **archive for** my **daughter, my family, and the** Apsáalooke. I will **be an archive that provides access to my** community\*\*,\*\* an archive **that is warm** not cold, an **archive the speaks** in **collaboration** with **the community and** the **ancestors that** came **before**.

Ghosts in **the** Microfiche

Their work illuminates oft-erased and unacknowledged queer and trans narratives, people**, **and places. The artist creates conceptual and geographical maps of queer life of the past, present**, and future **through material deviance and re-imaging craft practices**.

**197**

When I go to the archive, I am looking for ghosts. I **am** searching for **stories** and **figures** who

straddle the **threshold of** the (in\*\*)**visible and appear in the spaces between the text. I am seeking people who move through the world unseen, appear suddenly and vividly**, and\*\* then disappear again in an **instant**.

In **2016**, in the **wake** of President Obama declaring **the** Stonewall Inn **bar** a **national monument,** The *New* York *Times* published **a slew of** articles regarding the **event** commonly **referred to as** Stonewall, which **occurred at** the site of **the** Stonewall Inn on the night **of** June **28**, **1969.** The **Stonewall** uprising was **in** response to frequent police brutality **of queer and trans people** who **socialized at** this (and other) New York City **spaces** and is **credited** with sparking contemporary Western **gay** liberation. The **articles** in the *Times* presented a **singular overarching narrative of** Stonewall **focused** on who should be credited with instigating **this world**-changing night **or** who **threw the first** brick. **Nowhere** in **these articles did** Stormé **DeLarverie** appear.

and **trans**  
**Stormé** DeLarverie's **role** in **the** Stonewall **rebellion** was **critical,** and **her role** in **queer** liberation extended far beyond that night. DeLarverie **was a legendary** mixed-race butch lesbian drag king from Louisiana. She was **a staple** of **The Jewel Box revue,** often performing **at the** Apollo **Theatre** in **Harlem**; a bouncer at the landmark lesbian bars Henrietta Hudson and The Cubbyhole; and a mentor to young **queer** people until **her death** at the **age of ninety**-**three**. DeLarverie did not appear in any of **these articles**, even **though** *The **New** York Times*\*,\*\*\* only two **years earlier**, had published a beautiful obituary detailing **her** remarkable **life** and impact.

199

In the wake of *The New* York *Times* disappearing Stormé from **their paper, I** went looking for her ghost in the microfiche. Microfiche is ever shifting\*\*. Text\*\* and **image are** slowly brought **into** focus when the hand **delicately turns** the knob on the **magnifier, but trying to center the** words and **image** has been, for me, impossible, which **has ultimately** been more **productive**. I find my encounters with microfiche and the fragmented narratives **they enlarge** more **telling of a story** and how it **was** formed than **tales** that present **themselves as a cohesive** whole.

Deep in the microfiche archives of the New **York** Public Library, there **was** Stormé\*\*, a big grin\*\* on **her** handsome **face**, her body **framed** by two photographs **of her past selves. I cut and spliced** to **reconfigure the** narrative, to bring her ghost back into the room. In Stormé ***at***<i> Stonewall,</i> **these** collaged \*\*texts-\*\*fragments **of** one article pieced with **others--are** printed **on translucent Duratrans** with **neon** illuminating them **so that the visible** intertwined with **the** invisible **becomes** the site **of** the story. The light **boxes, choreographed to** flicker via **four**-**channel oscillator, occupy**, like an apparition, the in-between space and illuminate and summon **Stormé** into **the** room.

**1. Author's** note: Stormé ***at Stonewall***, **an installation** of **fourteen lightboxes**, was commissioned by The Brooklyn **Museum** and premiered in the exhibition *Nobody* Promised You Tomorrow: Contemporary Art After *Stonewall*, 2019. **The** piece was **acquired** by the National Portrait Gallery (Washington\*\*,\*\* DC) **in 2022.**

**Ms.** DeLarverie had earlier lived at **the** Chelsea **Hotel** in Manhattan for decades. She made her living working security at the Cubby Hole and later **for Ms.** Cannistraci at Henrietta Hudson\*\*.\*\* But she regarded the whole neighborhood as **within** her jurisdiction\*\*. she had\*\* lived for 25 years with a dancer named Diana\*\*,\*\* who died in the 1870s,  
**and** always carried **her photograph**.

What might be possible if we choose to listen to **speculative, fictive,** and **imagined** histories that attend to--who and what-colonial archives cannot historicize? In what ways **can we** articulate **"histories that** no **history** book can **tell"? Hartman proposes an archival** intervention termed Critical *Fabulation*. This **narrative** method **veers** from the mere **recitation** of historical facts to instead imagine **"what might have happened or might have been said or might have been done." Adopting this speculative framework, my AI-guided artistic research-Igun-is** anchored by **the** subjunctive question: What **artifacts** *might have **been produced*** **during** a seventeen-year (1897-1914) **decline in the production** of Benin Bronzes? This **corpus of** approximately 4,000 **pillaged artifacts** from **the** pre-colonial Benin Kingdom **spans** both **religious** and quotidian objects, including metals **cast** in **the** round **and** in **relief, ivory carvings,** wood carvings, leather works, and **coral** beaded **jewelry**.

**I am particularly interested** in **how** the colonially **induced artistic recession transformed the** cultural protocols governing **the** production **and** patronage **of** figurative **bronze objects. Bronze**, a **material procured** from communities along the West **African coast** and **Portugal, was regulated by** sumptuary laws\*\*, issued\*\* by **the Oba** (King)—the “**sole** commissioner **of the arts**." **These laws** mandated bronze casters to **operate within** the **palace** complex\*\*, thereby\*\* guaranteeing **the Oba's participation** in pre- and **post**-**production** rituals.

**However**, **the 1897 British** colonial invasion **triggered a series of** cataclysmic **events**, including the razing **of the palace** complex, the mass **pillage of** cultural **artifacts, and the exile of the** Oba, **which** plunged \*\*the once-\*\*thriving art **scene** into **a recession** until **the** restoration of **the** monarchy in 1914. **Consequently, in the absence of an Oba whose financial** sponsorship had **facilitated** a full-time **artistic practice,** Benin bronze **casters** were **forced** to **migrate to satellite** towns and **resort to subsistence** farming **as a** means **of survival**. Despite colonial intelligence **reports** alluding to a **bustling-albeit colonially exploited**-art **market** between 1897 and **1914**, **there** remains **a dearth of visual or archival documentation** to **substantiate these claims. I surmise that** there was little, **if** any, **artistic** production during \*\*the seventeen-\*\*year period.

In the face **of** archival absence, I return to Hartman's imaginative experiment with questions: If royal authorization was a requisite, did Benin bronze casters continue **to fabricate objects** during the seventeen-year period? If they did continue, what forms could have **been fabricated**? What raw materials could have been utilized? What themes could have been explored?

**To visualize** and imagine these unknown Benin Bronzes\*\*,\*\* I **have** trained a **Generative** AI model on a **dataset of** looted Benin Bronzes. The resulting AI-generated prototypes do not **suggest** any fidelity to **the** truth but simply point to an experiment that gives visibility to objects **that could exist outside** verifiable **archival** records.

PIO ABAD

*Thoughtful Gifts*

**Pio *Abad's* artistic practice is concerned with the personal and political entanglements of objects.** His **wide-ranging body of work**, **encompassing drawing**, **painting**, **textiles, installation, and text, mines alternative or repressed historical events and offers counternarratives that draw out threads of** complicity **between incidents**, **ideologies, and people. Deeply informed by unfolding events in the Philippines, where the artist was born and raised**, his work **emanates from** a **family narrative woven into the nation's story**. **Abad's parents were** at **the forefront** of **the anti**-**dictatorship struggle in the Philippines during the 1970s** and '**80s, and it is the** need to **remember this**

**history that has shaped the foundations of his** work.

**251**

**We** often think **of** the archive **as** a site for preservation **where** knowledge is **disseminated and history** is made accessible. **Yet,** more **often than** not, the **archive is a place where** knowledge is purposefully **lost**, **history** permanently **interred**.

My ongoing work, Thoughtful *Gifts*\*\*,\*\* is one attempt at exhumation. **It concerns a trove of** previously unseen **personal** and **official** documents **that I gathered from the** Ronald **Reagan presidential archives** in 2019, detailing **the Reagan administration's** entanglements with **the** Philippine **kleptocrats** Ferdinand **and** Imelda **Marcos**. **The Reagans first** met **the** Marcoses in 1969, **when Richard** Nixon **sent the then**-**governor of California** and his **wife Nancy to Manila** to **represent the** United **States at the** opening **of Imelda's pet** project, **the** Cultural Center **of the Philippines,** giving **the** political parvenu the imprimatur of Hollywood **and** Washington. **Seventeen years later, their** friendship **would** culminate in President **Reagan** sending **four** US Jolly Green Giant **helicopters to assist** the **Marcos** family **in** absconding from Malacañang **Palace** moments before two million Filipinos **demanding their ouster overwhelmed the palace gates**.

In **these** works, government **documents are laser engraved** onto **slabs of** Carrara marble, **the**

**process** of inscription becoming an **act** of implication, itemising **specific** moments **of** complicity.

**253**

Invoices and memos **testify** to **the** culture **of** impunity enabled by **the United States: a** US **Air** Force invoice for $**183,538 details the cost of airlifting the Marcoses** from **Manila to their** luxurious Honolulu **exile; a White** House memo from William **Ball** III\*\*, assistant\*\* to **President Reagan**, confirms the $858,417 spent to **temporarily accommodate the exiled dictator** and **his** family at Hickam **Air Force Base;** and a note from US Senator **Orrin** Hatch **proposes that the Marcoses** fund **a convention center** in **downtown** Honolulu to **distract** from **the furious local** response to the **kleptocrats** being coddled by **their American** handlers in **Hawaii**.

**Correspondence bears** witness **to** the **close friendship** between Ronald, Nancy\*\*, Imelda,\*\* and Ferdinand\*\*-a\*\* relationship forged by **the** couples' **shared proficiency** in manipulating personal myth for political gain. A letter written by Nancy to **Imelda reassures the latter of the judicial processes that she** can **avail of under** the US **courts, which would** eventually find **her** innocent **of all fraud** and **racketeering charges**. A **plea** from Ferdinand **that Ronald intervenes** with **the investigation** ends with the **valediction**, **"I remain** your obedient servant," undermining the **rhetoric of national self-realisation** that **the dictator weaponised** during his rule.

**255**

The **gesture of** inscribing these **ephemera** onto marble monumentalises **the paper trail** of **empire,** functioning **as** a symbolic **recuperation of a repressed** chapter in American history and a **material** repudiation of ongoing **attempts at historical distortion**.

The title of **the series**, *Thoughtful **Gifts,*** **is itself indicative of the violence of** taxonomy **within** the archive\*\*, a\*\* mutual by-**product of lazy categorisation and** wilful **obfuscation**. A **collection** of gifts from **the** unsavoury **characters** that **were embraced** by **Reagan's realpolitik were labelled** "thoughtful gifts" by **the** White **House.** This classification **included a life-size American eagle** statue **ornamented** with **seashells and mother of pearl presented by the Marcoses during a controversial** 1982 **state visit;** a kitsch folk **painting** from **the Guatemalan president Efraín** Ríos Montt **depicting** the **very same Mayan Indians** that **were massacred during** his **regime**; and an **oil** paint portrait **of British** Prime Minister **Margaret Thatcher gifted** to **the Reagans on** the proviso **that it be** on **permanent and** prominent **display.** Within **this seemingly** benign **nomenclature is a nexus** of individuals, communities\*\*, and ideologies that have benefited\*\* from **and been** annihilated **by** the United **States's quest for** geopolitical dominance and the **perpetuation of** its **political** mythologies.

**Washington**, **D.C.**

Dear Nr. President\*\*:\*\*  
**20500**

**I have no other recourse** except **to write you this letter**.

**Hy lawyers** inform **me that in** a **meeting** yesterday **called** by **the U.S. Department** of **Justice, U.S. Attorney Rudolf Guiliani, claiming** to **be with the full** knowledge **and approval of the** President **of the United** States\*\*, directed our lawyers that\*\* Mrs. Marcos **and I should plead guilty to** a **RICO substantive count by 5:00 p.m., Thursday, October 20,** 1988 (which **is today).**

**He said that this** was **not** a **negotiating proposal** but **was** a **last offer and not** subject to **negotiation**. **It was an ultimatum, not** a **proposal.**

Mrs. Marcos **and I plead that the President of the United States as** a **basic policy should** retain **the right to finally decide** to **indict or not** to **indict** a former or **present foreign head of state**. **This** present **confusion weakens the** U.S. **presidency.**

We **also plead that negotiations** be **allowed where** we **may show that there has been no stealing of public or private** funds -- **at** least **not by** Mrs. Marcos **and** me\*\*.\*\*

**Although we are ready to die for our principles, and we probably will, Imelda and I will ever be grateful to you.**

**Imelda sends her prayers to** you **and** Nancy\*\*.\*\*

**I remain your obedient** servant.
