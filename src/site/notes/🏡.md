# 🏡

hi, i'm Yone, and i am bad at gardening and keeping plants alive. however, i am good at collecting images and text and am sort of ok at keeping them alive. this is a digital garden to tend to them.

## the soil

this is a collection of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents in [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software), wrapped up in the [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) plugin created by [oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden).

## the roots

the thought about this being a "digital garden" made me think about ecosystems, which made me think about [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring), which are a beautiful things i encountered via [surfing the early queer internet](https://yone.house/lists#queer-internet) on wayback machine. they are a lively example of the more personal interactions the early internet fostered, and still exist in some online communities. i love their structure, however, if i understand it correctly, i think they would be better characterized as **biomes**--broader than ecosystems, just simply a themed collection and not *necessarily* an intermingling network.[^1]

> A **biome** (/ˈbaɪ.oʊm/]) is a distinct [geographical region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_region "Geographical region") with specific [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate"), [vegetation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation "Vegetation"), and [animal life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_life "Animal life"). It consists of a biological [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_\(ecology\) "Community (ecology)") that has formed in response to its physical environment and regional [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate").

[^1]: i might not understand all this correctly. my knowledge of biomes mostly comes from extensive playing of [Zoo Tycoon 1 & 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Tycoon) in childhood.
