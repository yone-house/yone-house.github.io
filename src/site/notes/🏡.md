> There is a verse we can recite when planting trees and other plants: 
> 
> *I entrust myself to Earth, 
> Earth entrusts herself to me. 
> I entrust myself to Buddha, 
> Buddha entrusts herself to me.* 
> 
> To plant a seed or a seedling is to entrust it to the earth. The plant will live or die because of the earth. But the earth also entrusts herself to the plant. Each leaf that falls down and decomposes will help the soil be alive.

-- Thich Nhat Hanh in [*The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching*](https://www.dwms.org/uploads/8/7/8/7/87873912/thich_nhat_hanh_-_the_heart_of_buddhas_teaching.pdf):

i am bad at gardening and keeping plants alive.[^1]

## however

i am good at collecting images and text and am sort of ok at keeping them alive.

## the soil

this is a collection of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents in [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software), wrapped up in the [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) plugin created by [oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden).

some of the sites built with this plugin *do* resemble a garden, but i am not sure how i feel about that terminology in the context of what i will imagine this to be.

## what i entrust

i am entrusting quite a lot in building this website--the software, the plugin, all the things the plugin requires, my laptop hard drive, the sites i link to, the internet in general. do these things entrust themselves to me?

what i imagine this will be is a collection of collections. of images, of documents, of text, of links, of annotations, of etc. etc. these collections will be far more important to me than they are to the things i am entrusting with them.
