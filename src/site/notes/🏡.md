# 🏡

i'm Yone, and i am bad at gardening and keeping plants alive. however, i am good at collecting images and text and am sort of ok at keeping them alive. this is a digital garden to tend to them.

my main domain is https://yone.house. it's so nice to give my house a garden.

<a href="#the-plants">main garden content is at the bottom of this page</a>.

## the soil

this is a collection of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents in [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)), wrapped up in the [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) plugin created by [oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). it is a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/yone-house/yone-house.github.io) deployed with GitHub pages.[^2] 

i am using the [LaTeX community theme](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Themes/LaTeX) for fun, because i miss writing proofs in LaTeX, but i've added a bunch of custom CSS so it's not really close at all to the original.

## the roots

the thought about this being a "digital garden" made me think about ecosystems, which made me think about [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring), which are a beautiful things i encountered via [surfing the early queer internet](https://yone.house/lists#queer-internet) on wayback machine. they are a lovely example of the personal interactions & connections the early internet fostered, and they still exist in some online communities.

i love their structure, however if i understand it correctly, i think they would be better characterized as **biomes**--broader than ecosystems, just simply a themed collection and not necessarily an intermingling network.[^1]

> [!NOTE]
> A **biome** (/ˈbaɪ.oʊm/]) is a distinct [geographical region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_region "Geographical region") with specific [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate"), [vegetation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation "Vegetation"), and [animal life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_life "Animal life"). It consists of a biological [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_\(ecology\) "Community (ecology)") that has formed in response to its physical environment and regional [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate").

they do intermingle a bit, though.

## the plants

this site is built as a collection of "gardenings", a local webring in my digital garden. a noun and a verb. each is a themed collection of webpages in this site distinguished by a kind of specific climate, vegetation, and animal life.

click the "next page" or "previous page" links to navigate the pages in a relatively intentional order i've chosen, or browse the graph and directory in each gardening home page to see what to choose from.

if you can, check out the "global" graph at the bottom of every page by clicking the globe icon in the graph pane. you can see & explore & drag around the entire structure of this garden and its paths (though it might require a little untangling).

please enjoy exploring :-)

[^1]: i might not understand all this correctly. my knowledge of biomes mostly comes from extensive playing of [Zoo Tycoon 1 & 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Tycoon) in childhood.

[^2]: the official plugin recommendation is Vercel, which i originally used, but [their CEO just met with Netanyahu to discuss "AI education"](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1972669025525158031) plus the general company primarily does spooky AI stuff, and so i swiftly moved off it to Cloudflare, which i then learned has datacenters in israel and provides the gov't with network security, and now i *think* i have figured out how do deploy to GitHub Pages instead. doing anything even moderately ethically on the internet is really hard.
