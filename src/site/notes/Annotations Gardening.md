# Welcome to *Annotations Gardening ðŸ“‘*

---

These are documents exported from my ereader, mostly highlighted quotes that are important to me with some annotations. Exported as .txt files and converted to .md format. 

Accompanying texts might be found in Texts Gardening ðŸ“–, but maybe not. I do have all of them, so feel free to reach out if you want a free copy. doorbell@yone.house. 

*View the graph or links at the bottom to search through directory and structure, or just jump in with the links below.*
