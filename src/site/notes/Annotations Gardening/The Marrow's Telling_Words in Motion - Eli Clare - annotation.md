The stones in the following pieces range from 
the damage reeked by Chnstian missionaries to a 
retelling of my birth, from child sexual abuse” to disability politics. They emerge from no one source but 
many: intimate history, community knowledge, 
activist thinking, letters of a long-ago white explorer 
and the sweep of my imagination today, all intertwined, all somehow connected to the body.

These lone words can be useful but never enough: 
Eight-years-old, I carried my kite down to the hayfields and sheep pastures, flew it for hours on end, 
spinning line out, five hundred feet, a thousand. I can 
still feel that tug on my arm.

With whom do we break the bone open? And once 
broken, what does the telling take; how do we shift those 
stones across language, culture, community? And once 
translated, who listens and how?

To the Curious People Who Ask, 
“What Do Your Tremors Feel Like?” 
Tell me: have you ever watched 
hands play a piano? Fingers 
on the keys, ivory to skin, dance 
white to black and back again, run 
wild and loose, thump and caress 
the universe cradled inside 
a baby grand, those hands 
I lost at birth. Breath squeezed 
to empty gasps, I fell into the world, 
brain of my fingers half dead. 
Explain to me your hands resting 
still as water before they dance. 
That I cannot imagine.

They never get it night, but what I want to know is 
this: will you? When I walk through the world, will 
you simply scramble for the correct pronoun? Or 
will you imagine a river at dusk, its skin smooth 
and unbroken, sun no longer braided into sparkles? 
Cliff divers hurl their bodies from fifty feet, neither 
flying nor earth-bound, three somersaults and a 
half turn, entering the water free-fall without a nipple. Will you get it right?

Interlude V: Demand 
Certainly it’s necessary to tell it: 1 used to fly my 
kite for hours on end. And still today I can feel its 
tug, beckon of sky and wind. But by itself, story isn’t 
enough. 
We need to tell, talk, translate the marrow. Tell it as 
trouble—all the years of whispers, snickers, earnest questions, “Do you know this is the women’s restroom?” Tell it 
as joy—the first time your body felt alive and supple. Talk 
it as postmodern theory, teasing those ideas out of the 
bramble, or as a training for health-care providers. 
Translate it as history, policy, fierceness, rebellion, civil 
rights, a poem sung in the streets. 
Let story be that kite, wild blue of sky, tug and 
beckon, dialogue and demand.

Father of mine, I have a myth I tell myself. Not 
memory. Not fiction. Just clues tied one to the next as 
I walk the North Shore, sit among skeletal birch, 
watch gulls nestle between waves.
