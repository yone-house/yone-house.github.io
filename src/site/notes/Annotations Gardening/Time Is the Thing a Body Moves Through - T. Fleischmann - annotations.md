And there is maybe something joyous in that flight, even though it so often begins in terror, from the epidemics of sexual violence and suicide andsilence that live in this country’s hometowns—something joyous in survival.

We are both interested in the things that we came too late for, which means we’re going to have to do them ourselves. I talk about Samuel Delany, chattering on about how he loves dirty, bit fingernails and about Times Square Red, Times Square Blue, where he describes the shuttering of porn theaters in Manhattan as a blow to gay culture, setting liberation back decades.

so I’m sweaty and hurrying to go relax. I walk quickly to pass this group on the sidewalk, five adults and akid maybe four years old or so, although I’m bad at figuring out how old children are. As I walk by, the kid turns to me and says, “Hey, are you a girl?” and I smile and I say, “No,” and then the kid says, “Are you a boy?” and I smile and I say, “No,” and then the kid seems to think very carefully and says, “So you don’t haveto be a boy or a girl?” and I say, “That’s right, you got it, youdon’t,” and I smile again but start walking even more quickly because there are five adults with this kid and a lot of adults don’t want you to tell their kid to be a transsexual.
What matters though is that as I am walking ahead more quickly thekid yells out after me, “Hey! I live in a house with a door!” Thekid says it with a lot of confidence and a lot of happiness, really wanting me to know this. And I turn around and say, “Hey, me too!” and we both laugh and then I walk down the block.
Isn’t that so beautiful? “Hey, I live in a house with a door.” I’mhungry for truth and kids are just spouting facts up and down thestreet.

I’m probably missing the whole message, which is just, “Hey, I live in a house with a door.” And really, she reminds me, isn’t some information about being alive beautiful enough? That we dry forks and touch hair and throw away a sock?

Instead what I’m really writing is a love letter to prose, a book that is slutty about it. Like how pleasure, written into the structural, open field of prose, is so lively—the first descriptions of green life and friendship in Century of Clouds, a pestle and mortar in Zami.

It is difficult to recall what that total, exhaustive feeling of not knowing feels like now, but it is the feeling I had both in watching the collapse of the hotel and in first wrapping my hand around someoneelse’s cock.

I don’t know what it means to name myself when young, or to search from my mother’s living room for bodies in neighboring towns with a tap, tap. But I do know what it means to be unfixed from narrative, anunfixing that feels something like claiming power. I feel grateful for it, really. It meant that I traveled through space as a hotel burned.

People sometimes think there’s sadness to my romances because I prioritize long-distance relationships and relationships with people who are already in love with someone else. As Jackson not only lives in Australia but also has there an Australian

Long-distance is maybe misleading because it’s not distance (linear) so much as space (four-dimensional) that matters. When my ex-girlfriend or Simon or my ex-boyfriend played the game of exchanging visits with me, it was not as though there were a long linebetween, connecting us through distance, but rather we were the two endpoints of a hypotenuse and about us spun a sphere through which we could exalt and retreat.

It is when life is blown into you and so you breathe,
but also it is all the things of imagination and materiality thatmake us, the seamless union of our consciousness and ourunconscious, into an I.

The best version of me isn’t the person who falls in love, butthe person who takes love squarely for what it is,
as an occasion to know someone else, to learn about theirdesires, to be each a better self together,
so long as that is what we both want.
To hell with all that hurt, whatever came before.
We can have a love where we are both happy, in which we seeourselves for who we are—
standing there, where any story might begin.

“Once we believe that there is no God, that there is no afterlife,then life becomes a very positive statement.
It becomes a very political position because, then, we have nochoice but to work harder to make this place the best place ever.
There is only one chance, and this is it.
If you fuck it up this time, you’ve fucked up forever and ever,”Gonzalez-Torres said.

In a 1992 letter to his gallerist, Gonzalez-Torres reflected on another one of his takeaway pieces, a stack from which you can take an“uninscribed piece of paper,” which he called “Untitled” (Passport). In the letter, he considers the blank paper a source of beautiful possibility, “an untouched feeling.” In the same breath of thought, heoffers that this paper, once it is taken from the stack, should be inscribed with “the most painful, the most banal” as well as “the mostsublime.” It’s a dream where anyone can just walk up and take a passport, which is, yes, sublime, like love—and then we take that paper back out into the world, where passports are denied and seized, love severed in the process. As in an interview with Tim Rollins:
FGT: There is also, of course, Yvonne Rainer’s Journeys from Berlin and a movie by Sara Gómez called One Way or Another, whichis a feminist view of the Cuban revolution, Santeria, and other issues. This movie is very interesting because it’s also about themeaning of love during a particular historical period. I saw thatmovie the same week that I saw Hiroshima Mon Amour.
TR: That’s a great movie about love.
FGT: No, it’s about meaning and how meaning is dependent on the context.

Lots of people actually do have healthy and long-lasting and joyful relationships after doing these thirty-six love questions, which makes it seem like we’re all boring, horrible creatures who would get along fine if we just shared some information about our lives with one another, but who refuse to.

The way people react, I know that they are thinking about what they would call my gender and, in the way most people find gender and bodies to be irreducibly the same, that they are thinking also of my body, the small weight of my breasts maybe visible in a sweater.

The All-Friend, for instance, visited Philadelphia with six companions for the first time shortly after the end ofthe Revolutionary War, where they struggled to find lodging, turned away because of their strangely gendered attire.

They “appeared beautifully erect,” one man noted, while the Marquis de Chastellux, coming across some of the Friend’s followers in Philadelphia, was struck by the “young men … with large round flapped hats, and long flowing strait locks, with a sort of melancholy wildness in their countenances, and an effeminate, dejected air.” Who were these strange people, who call their leader “he”? And who was this preacher, so strikingly beautiful, and with a voice that sounded like a “croak”?

After the war, vengefulof what he saw as a betrayal and seeking land, George Washington sent Major General John Sullivan (that former commander from Rhode Island) with roughly one quarter of the Continental Army to wreak devastation on the Haudenosaunee. Begun in 1779 and finished in 1780, the Sullivan Expedition wasone of many horrors, the burning of homes and crops and the destruction of any locatable resources, up the Susquehanna River to the Great Lakes, with the majority of the indigenous people driven north and west as refugees.

Still, were the Haudenosaunee to offer peace, Washington instructed, they should receive only “terror,” and Sullivan’s men continuedon, writing in their journals of the beauty of the homes and orchards they destroyed.

The thing about the lake freezing is that I don’t have any idea what its system is. It’s not that it just freezes when it’s cold enough, because sometimes it is surprisingly warm and the lake freezes, and sometimes it has been bitterly goddamn cold for days and the lake is liquid.

He doesn’t manipulate the pictures digitally but instead creates images that suggest a false past of digital manipulation. This is done lo-fi, just mirrors, lights, strings, all in multitudes, all reflections of suspensions of reflections of glow. A giant rectangular mirrored tube with orange flowers like a lipstick, engorging out of its top, and the mirrors reflecting the grass andbugs and trees around it, and some sky. Or a cave, its first cavern illuminated pink and its outer edges electrically blue by the lights Benjy casts, and the pond outside it electrically blue, too, all to frame a neon sign reading Soft Butch in pink-and-blue cursive.

The distinction is between narrative and something else, between the way a town looks in a photograph and the way a town looks whenyou play flashlight tag in it and you are nervous. Sometimes it takes so much momentum to escape your context that you seem to never stop straining at escape after that. Sometimes you meet people you love but that still won’t be enough because you won’t know who you are, when you are someone who isn’t alone.

Or perhaps some of the water he included, along with theserelocations, in a 1993 version of his portrait,

His personal correspondences are also wet with the stuff.
“Never thought that a natural element, such as the falls would
generate such an incredible array of fetishisms,
Niagara cups, belts, lanyards, key holders, etc.”
he wrote to a friend after viewing the Falls.
“Well it was OK,”
Ross added to the note,
“but they weren’t as big as I thought they would be …”
Or maybe, like his autobiography, the water is just that—
waves of itself, lapping body and land.
Sung, inside a body again.
And then a body, singing of land and water.

Sometimes the arms go up, and then they go back down.
The piece first went on display in 1991, as part of the show
Every Week There Is Something Different.

 Finally, at a house party that is a fund-raiser for a community bail bond, someone clues me in that it’s my testosterone blockers, something about the way theyhave accumulated in my body, that have done this.

There are all these mysteries to a body. Why, or how. This sense that I’m an experiment, that I am coming together. That I need someone else to tell me about me.

And I do my best to join that work as a person who has taken the time to heal, because you help other people better once you’ve helped yourself. This is back in our apartment, Jackson teaching meto put my feet flat on the ground and to breathe and to identify where my strength is inside of me. Healing includes talking and crying, until I feel like I understand what has happened and what it means to me, and sometimes I talk about things from a long timeago, and sometimes from now. Jackson draws from his practice as abody worker, and sometimes I sit and I think of all the people who have survived who I did not think were going to survive, and

then I think of myself alive. Some nights we gather all the houseplants and put them in the bathroom, then we run the shower all the way up to get everything steamy and light candles, and then we run a hot bath and sit in it together, what Jackson calls a Jurassic Sauna, with a Sade album on. And after that I eat some homemade kraut out of a stone crock, and then I’m ready to be a person doing something, and to think about what I’m doing, and whoI’m doing it with.

I don’t want to claim any expertise on the artist, and hope to engage with his work horizontally—if anything, opening up space forfurther meaning rather than exerting any sort of authority. But itreally helped me to think—encountering his work did—and I am appreciative of that, and hope to share some of it.
